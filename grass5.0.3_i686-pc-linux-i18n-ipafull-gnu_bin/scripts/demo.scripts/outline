Executive Overview (GRASS 4.x)
	GRASS
		GIS
	Hardware
		micro/mini/workstation
		printer
		solid-color plotter
		digitizer
	People requirements
		multi-user computer management
		experts in land analysis/management
		expert in GIS
		GRASS is a powerful programming language for manipulating maps
		note isolation in Europe
What is GIS
	Vector GIS
		GRASS basically is not though does have some
			digitizing
			simple map display
		Objects are outlined, data stored as lines
		Higher resolution / less data for simple items
		Does not handle elevation well
		Can not handle images
		For engineering and architecture
		Army Intergraph contract
	Raster GIS
		Checkerboard landscape
		Maps stored as images
		Analyses similsr to RDBMS analyses
		Handles satellite and air-photo images
		For natural (few edges) land management
GRASS Capabilities
	Map analysis
		boolean (and/or) overlays
		weighted overlays
		inference (rules)
		mathematical combination
		coincidence tabulation
		statistics
		reports
	Image analysis
		geo-referencing
		classification
		change detection
	Map display
		video
			2-dimension
			3-dimension
		hard-copy
			2-dimension
GRASS Data
	stored in checkerboard format
		values generally category numbers
		values can be real integers (elevation, slope)
		files supported with statistics, history info, cat names
	stored in vector format
		digitized into this format
		used to produce cell maps
		provides vector overlays

GRASS Future
	Mix GRASS tools with
		RDBMS
		IFS
		Report writers
		Expert systems
		Graphics
	Provide packaged models
Future (GRASS)
	time-series capabilities
	enhanced graphics
