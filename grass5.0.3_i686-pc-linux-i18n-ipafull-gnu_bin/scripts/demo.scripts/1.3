  GRASS  does not REPLACE people.

  It does provide an opportunity for people to do
  jobs not before possible.   This can result in a
  restructuring of the personnel in an office or
  the modification of job descriptions.

  COMPUTER SUPPORT
.C white
  GRASS runs on multi-user machines which require
  constant attention.  The support person must know
  UNIX fairly well and be available perhaps 2-3 hours
  a day for system management functions.

  USERS
.C white
  While GRASS users can do some things with GRASS
  without knowing much UNIX, a knowledge of this
  operating system is essential for gaining maximum
  benefit from the software.  Users must either
  maintain a strong understanding of UNIX and GRASS
  -OR- have access to someone who does.
