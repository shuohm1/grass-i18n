<H3>Scripting</H3>
</A> <P>

<H4>NVIZ - Introduction</H4> <P>

Sometimes it is desirable to automatically generate arbitrarily
complicated changes to Nviz when creating an animation.  The tools
presented so far allow the user to create camera movement as well as
add custom animation channels (e.g. the cut plane channel) to the
key frame animator.  However, the user would be required to add several
complex channels to the key frame animator to capture the most general
behavior.  The purpose of the scripting environment is to allow the
user to develop a one-time script file which can handle arbitrarily
complex changes to the Nviz environment.  Script files are extremely
application dependent and, in general, will not be usable with other
applications.  However, they are the most convenient mechanism for
capturing specific behavior quickly.  <P>

Scripting is controlled by the commands provided in the scripting
pulldown menu (see <A HREF="#ScriptPulldown">figure</A> below).  By
default, when scripting has been activated every user event in Nviz is
recorded and output to a script saved as a text file.  This script
file may be played back in Nviz by using the <I>Play Script</I> option
in the menu.  Thus, most scripts are simply a carbon copy of the user
performing certain actions.  Scripting can become more powerful,
however, by adding loops around a sequence of script events, or by
using higher-level tools.  The more advanced features of scripting are
described in the <A HREF="#ScriptTools">Script Tools</A> section below.
The next section is devoted to describing basic scripting.  Be sure to
read this section carefully as the discussion of advanced features
assumes the knowledge of this material.
<P>

<H3>
<IMG SRC="nvimg/work/script_pulldown.gif">
<A NAME="ScriptPulldown"> Script Pulldown Menu</A>
</H3>

<H4>Basic Scripting</H4> <P>

Basic scripting entails designating a script file, turning scripting
on and off, and sending commands directly to the script.  Before doing
anything with scripting it is necessary to designate a script file.
This is done by selecting the <I>Scriptfile</I> option in the script
pulldown menu.  The user is queried for a file to use as the new
script file.  If the designated file already exists then scripting
will overwrite the old contents of the file.
<P>

Once a script file has been selected, scripting is turned on and off by
selecting the <I>On</I> radio button in the scripting menu.  The status
of this radio button indicates whether or not scripting is active.  As
soon as scripting becomes active, literally everything the user does
is recorded in the script file.  Since this can lead to extremely large
script files, it is suggested that scripting be turned on only when the
next few user events are critical to the script.  When you are
finished adding commands to the script, select <I>Close Script</I> to
close the script file.
<P>

To make the script files somewhat more legible and useful, two
additional commands are available in basic scripting: <I>Add Script
Line</I> and <I>Add Script Cmd</I>.  The difference between these two
commands is subtle but important.  We will delay a discussion of the
differences between these two commands for now.  For our purposes, the
difference between these two commands is as follows: <I>Add Script
Line</I> adds a command directly to the script being written and will
not affect the state of Nviz; <I>Add Script Cmd</I> adds a command to
the script which <B>will</B> affect the state of Nviz.  A script in
Nviz is really a Tcl script with a slightly specialized format.
Hence, legal script commands are things like comments marked with the
<B>#</B> character, expressions like <B>set i [expr $i + 1]</B>, and
so on.  <I>Add Script Line</I> is intended to add commands which
directly affect the Tcl code in the script.  Thus comments can be
added making scripts more readable, variables may be accessed, and
conditionals may be inserted allowing the script to select different
execution paths depending on script variables.  Commands added by
<I>Add Script Cmd</I> may also be Tcl commands.  However, these
commands are executed directly in the Nviz environment and affect the
current state of Nviz directly (but <B>do not</B> affect the state of
the script).  Thus commands like <B>Nsurf10001 set_att topo
y90o.1</B>, which will set the topology attribute of a particular
surface to a particular file, are meaningful commands to add.
 <P>

The combination of <I>Add Script Line</I> and <I>Add Script Cmd</I>
provide the most general tools for controlling script files short of
directly editing the text of a script.  It is expected that these
commands will rarely be used.  However, <I>Add Script Line</I> in
particular is useful for placing comments to separate distinct
portions of a script and make the overall script file more readable.
 <P>

<H4>
<A NAME="ScriptTools">Script Tools</A>
</H4>
 <P>

The <I>Script Tools</I> menu selection pops up the script tools menu
which provides higher level script manipulation facilities.  It is
possible to do everything a script tool does by using <I>Add Script
Line</I> and <I>Add Script Cmd</I> described above.  However, the
script tools are much more convenient and should be used instead.
Currently, there are three types of tool covering the five selections
in the script tool popup.  <I>Open Loop</I> and <I>Close Loop</I>
allow iteration using a numeric loop variable.  <I>Open File
Seq. Loop</I> and <I>Close File Seq. Loop</I> allow iteration over a
series of files.  Finally, the <I>File Sequence Tool</I> allows very
general iteration over a variety of attributes associated with
surface, vector and site maps.  Be sure that scripting has been turned
on (by selecting <I>On</I>) before using a script tool.  The <I>File
Sequence Tool</I> does not necessarily require scripting to be on, but
for now we assume scripting has been activated.
<P>

<H5><I>Open and Close Loop</I></H5> <P>

The simplest tool is the <I>Open/Close Loop</I> pair.  This tool
defines a loop variable given the name <B>lpX</B> where X is the
current loop being defined (starting with 1).  The loop variable is
iterated over a numeric range as specified by the user.  The user may
add commands (using <I>Add Script Line</I>) which reference the loop
variable.  The most general functionality provided by this tool is the
ability to repeat some script activity a specified number of times.
<P>

A simple <I>Open/Close Loop</I> is created as follows:
<UL>
<LI> Select <I>Open Loop</I> from the script tools menu.
<LI> Fill in numeric values for "Loop Start Value", "Loop End Value"
and "Loop Increment Value" in the resulting popup (see <A HREF="#SimpLoopP">
figure</A> below), and press "Accept".
<LI> Continue scripting as usual adding all activities over which you
wish to iterate.
<LI> Close the loop by selecting <I>Close Loop</I> from the script
tools menu.
</UL>
 <P>

<H5>
<A NAME="SimpLoopP">
<IMG SRC="nvimg/work/SimpLoop.gif"> Simple Loop Popup
</A>
</H5> <P>

Note that simple loops may be nested by repeating the above process
from within a simple loop.  Each additional loop uses the same naming
scheme, thus the outer loop will be <B>lp1</B>, the first nested loop
is <B>lp2</B> and so on.  Internally a stack of loop names is
maintained so that selecting <I>Close Loop</I> closes the most
recently opened loop.
 <P>

<H5><I>Open and Close File Seq. Loop</I></H5> <P>

Simple open/close loops work well when looping behavior is relatively
simple.  However, simple loops are restricted to iterating over
numeric values.  A common scenario is for some map object in the scene
to display a sequence of map files.  That is, we need to be able to
iterate over lists of files.  The <I>Open/Close File Seq. Loop</I>
pair provide this functionality.  This tool, when activated, forces
any mapBrowser activities within the scope of the loop to use the
current loop iteration value rather than the value entered by the user
when the script is created.  Creating a file loop is slightly awkward
but follows these basic steps:

<UL>
<LI> Select <I>Open File Seq. Loop</I> from the script tools menu.
<LI> Select a sequence of files using the Map Browser tool (see
<A HREF="#FBrowseP">figure</A> below), and press "Done".
<LI> Continue scripting as usual adding all activities over which you
wish to iterate.
<LI> If you wish to apply the file sequence to a particular map,
modify the appropriate map as if you were loading a file from the file
sequence (see the <A HREF="#FileSeqEx">example</A> below).
<LI> Close the loop by selecting <I>Close File Seq. Loop</I> from the
script tools menu.
</UL>
 <P>

<H5>
<A NAME="FBrowseP">
<IMG SRC="nvimg/work/FBrowse.gif"> File Sequence Loop Popup
</A>
</H5>
 <P>

Like simple loops, file sequence loops may be nested as well as mixed
with simple loops (make sure that you use the appropriate "Close"
button however!).  File sequence loops use a naming scheme similar to
simple loops.  File sequence iteration values can be accessed using
the variable <B>lseqX</B> where X starts at 1 for the first loop and
increments by 2 for consecutive loops (thus the next loop is 3, then
5, and so on).  <P>

To help clarify how the file sequence loop value can automatically be
used by map browser activities, consider the following explicit
example:
 <P>

<A NAME="FileSeqEx"></A>
Suppose we want the topology of a surface map to sequence over a list
of files (for example, the four file sequence shown in the map browser
image above).  We can use the file sequence loop tool to do this as
follows: 
<OL>
<LI> Turn on scripting as usual.
<LI> Set up the state of Nviz just prior to iterating over the list of
files.  This includes loading the surface we wish to modify during
the loop. 
<LI> Open the file sequence loop with <I>Open File Seq. Loop</I>.
<LI> Select the list of files we wish to iterate over as above.
<LI> Load some arbitrary file into the topology attribute of the
surface we wish to modify in the loop.
<LI> Close the file sequence loop with <I>Close File Seq. Loop</I>.
</OL>
 <P>

When the script event corresponding to changing topology (step 5
above) is replayed in Nviz, the current value of the file sequence
loop is used instead of the value supplied during script creation.
Thus, during each iteration of the loop the topology attribute is set
to the current value of the file sequence loop.
 <P>

Be aware that the file sequence loop affects <B>all</B> map browser
activities within the scope of the loop.  Thus <B>any</B> script
events added within the scope of a loop which also require a map
browser will have their value replaced during script playback with the
current value of the file loop.  
 <P>

<H5><I>File Sequence Tool</I></H5> <P>

<H5><B>Introduction</B></H5> <P>

The final script tool, the <I>File Sequence Tool</I>, is the most
complicated but also the most flexible.  This tool is designed to
allow iteration over several attributes of several maps in Nviz.
Unlike the two previous tools, the <I>File Sequence Tool</I> is
capable of automatically producing a stand-alone script file which can
be played back within Nviz.  <P>

Creating a script using the <I>File Sequence Tool</I> consists of two
major steps: creating a state file, and creating a file sequence.
State files were discussed in the appropriate section above.  For the
purposes of scripting, the <I>File Sequence Tool</I> can use a state
file as a basis for the script it creates.  Usually, the user sets up
Nviz in a configuration just prior to the beginning of file iteration
and saves the state of Nviz.  The script created by the <I>File
Sequence Tool</I> can then load this state file automatically before
performing file iteration.  The <A HREF="#FSToolEx">example</A> below
should help clarify these activities.  For now, let us take a detailed
look at the <I>File Sequence Tool</I> control window. <P>

The <I>File Sequence Tool</I> control window is activated by selecting
<I>File Sequence Tool</I> from the script tools popup:
 <P>

<H5>
<A NAME="FSToolImg"></A>
<IMG SRC="nvimg/work/FSTool.gif"> File Sequence Tool Window
</H5>
 <P>

The <I>File Sequence Tool</I> operates on the concept of
<B>fields</B>.  A field identifies some attribute of a surface,
vector, or site map which will be modified during an animation.  The
lower area of the <I>File Sequence Tool</I> is used to display all the
fields currently set.  In the example above, a single field is defined
which modifies the topography attribute of a surface in Nviz.  The
buttons under <I>Fields:</I> are used to manipulate the current list
of fields.  Pressing <I>Add</I> will create a new field.  Pressing
<I>Delete</I> will allow the user to delete one of the fields.  The
<I>State:</I> button is used to determine the state file which the
current fields will use a basis for script creation.
 <P>

Before we discuss how to add fields, it is important to understand
what types of fields may be added and how they may be changed.  As
mentioned before, a field identifies some attribute of a surface,
vector or site map that we wish to change during each frame of an
animation.  For surfaces, we can modify the attributes topography,
color, mask, transparency, shininess, and emission.  For vectors and
sites, we can only modify the current file.  Furthermore, there are at
least three simple ways we can change a field inbetween frames: we can
load a new file in the place of the current file; we can <I>unset</I>
the field so that it has no value; and we can leave the field
unchanged.  The <I>File Sequence Tool</I> supports all of the
attributes we have listed plus the three simplest ways of changing
these attributes inbetween frames.  
 <P>

<H5><B>Adding Fields</B></H5> <P>

Adding a field is a two step process: the user must decide which
attribute of which surface, vector or site to modify; and the user
must specify the list of changes to the selected attribute.  Pressing
the <I>Add</I> button creates the following popup:
 <P>

<H5>
<IMG SRC="nvimg/work/AddField.gif">
Add Button Popup</H5> <P>

<I>Field Type:</I> refers to the type of map object this field will
modify.  Valid selections are <I>Surface</I>, <I>Vector</I> or
<I>Site</I>.  <I>Field Attribute:</I> refers to what attribute of the
given type the new field will modify.  For surfaces, valid selections
are <I>Topography</I>, <I>Color</I>, <I>Mask</I>, <I>Transparency</I>,
<I>Shininess</I>, and <I>Emission</I>.  For vectors or sites, the only
valid selections is <I>File</I>.  <I>Set From:</I> refers to a
surface, vector or site file in the <B>current</B> session of Nviz
which will be used as the placeholder for changes in the new field.
When a script is created, the <I>Set From</I> map object has the
specified attribute changed according to the new field.  Thus, the
<I>Set From</I> map object should also be stored in the state file
used by this file sequence.
 <P>

After selecting an appropriate type, attribute and source map object,
clicking <I>Accept</I> creates the file browser popup:
 <P>

<H5>
<IMG SRC="nvimg/work/FSToolBrowse.gif">
Field File List Popup</H5> <P>

Normally, the file browser will have no selected files.  However, for
the sake of illustration we have already selected a few files in the
image above.  The <B>MAPSETS</B> and <B>FILES</B> lists operate just
as in the <I>Open/Close File Seq. Loop</I> tool above.  When a file is
selected, its name is copied to the file list on the far right.  File
names may be entered explicitly in the type-in field on the top.  The
list of files on the far right indicates the sequence of changes the
current field will undergo when a script is created.  Recall that the
<I>File Sequence Tool</I> supports three mechanisms for changing a
field between frames: load a new file, unset the field, or leave the
field alone.  Selecting a file from the <B>FILES</B> list corresponds
to loading a new file inbetween frames.  By pressing the <I>Blank</I>
button, the field is directed to unset the field for the next frame.
This is indicated by storing <I>-- blank --</I> as the next file in
the file list.  By pressing the <I>Previous</I> button, the field is
directed to make no changes to the field and use the setting for the
previous frame.  This is indicated by storing <I>(NO CHANGE) ***</I>
where <I>***</I> is the previous entry in the file list.
 <P>

For example, in the image above the file list changes can be described
as follows:
<OL>
<LI> <I>a1.masked@helena</I> is loaded.
<LI> Nothing is changed for frame 2.
<LI> The current field is <I>unset</I> and will not be displayed.
<LI> <I>a3.masked@helena</I> is loaded.
<LI> <I>as.2m100@helena</I> is loaded.
</OL>
 <P>

The <I>Remove</I> button removes the selected file entry from the file
list.  The <I>Done</I> button is used to indicate that you are
finished creating the file sequence for the current field.  Clicking
<I>Cancel</I> will backup to the <I>Add Button Popup</I>.  Clicking
<I>Cancel</I> on the <I>Add Button Popup</I> will cancel the creation
of a new field.
 <P>

The file sequence for a particular field may be changed even after it
has been added to the field list.  Each field in the <I>File Sequence
Tool Window</I> contains a button which indicates the type of map
object this field modifies (see the <A HREF="#FSToolImg">image</A>
above).  Clicking this button pops up the file browser as above except
that the list of files is initialized to the current file list for the
selected field.
 <P>

<H5><B>Saving Fields</B></H5> <P>

A particular configuration of fields can be saved for later editing by
using the <I>Load Fields...</I> and <I>Save Fields...</I> options
under the <I>Options:</I> heading.  <I>Save Fields...</I> will save
all of the current field configurations plus the name of the
associated state file for later user.  Conversely, <I>Load
Fields...</I> will load a configuration of fields.  Note that, in
order to edit a group of fields in a different Nviz session, it will
be necessary to re-load the state of Nviz that existed when the
original fields were created.  This is necessary so that the map
objects which the original fields referenced will be present in the
system if these fields are changed.
 <P>

<H5><B>Building a Script</B></H5> <P>

Once the user has created all the necessary fields for a particular
script, it is possible to create a playable script file.  There are
two ways script information can be created: script information can be
written to a script currently being created, or a separate,
stand-alone script can be created.  In either case, the script code
created will only create the changes indicated by the given fields
over the given number of frames.  Extra code, such as code necessary
for rendering and saving images after each frame, must be added
separately.  Since adding image saving code is a frequent activity, a
comment is added to the code produced by the <I>File Sequence Tool</I>
to aid the user in determining where to add code.
 <P>

Clicking <I>Add To Script</I> will add code to the current active
script which will invoke the changes indicated by the field files.
Make sure that scripting has been turned on (see above) before using
this option.
 <P>

Clicking <I>Build Script...</I> will build a stand-alone script file.
Stand-alone scripts first load the state file, then the field changes
are executed as specified by the field descriptions.  As usual, code
must be added to the script to render images and save them to files.
 <P>

<H5><B>Example</B></H5> <P>

The following step-by-step example should help clarify the creation of
a script using the <I>File Sequence Tool</I>.
 <P>

<!-- Create an example of file tool scripting here -->
<A NAME="FSToolEx"></A>

For this example, we will specify one surface with a vector and site
file overlayed on top of it.  At each frame, we will change the
topography and color attributes of the surface, and the overlay files
for the sites map.  This animation will be a stand-alone animation.
Recall that creating an animation with the <I>File Seq. Tool</I>
requires two major steps: creating a state file and creating the field
specifications.  Since we will need all the appropriate maps loaded
into Nviz before we can create the field specifications, we will go
ahead and create the state file first:
 <P>

<OL>
<LI> Start up Nviz with "nviz -q".
<LI> Add the surface "y90o.1@helena" by pressing <I>New</I> on the
surface panel.
<LI> Position the camera so that the surface is in full view.
<LI> Add the vector map "shore.ascii@helena" by pressing <I>New</I> on
the vector panel.
<LI> Set the vector map so that it overlays the surface we added in
step 2 above.
<LI> Add the sites map "y90mo.1@helena" by pressing <I>New</I> on the
sites panel.
<LI> Set the sites map so that it overlays the surface we added in step
2 above.
<LI> Set an appropriate size for the sites map.
<LI> Save the state of Nviz by selecting <I>Save State...</I> from the
<I>File</I> menu and choosing an appropriate name.
</OL>
 <P>

At this point, we have established the state of Nviz before our
animation will begin.  State files provide a convenient encapsulation
of the state of Nviz just prior to beginning animation.  In fact, we
may alter state files independently of the scripts which require them
as long as we do not change the map objects required by each script.
This allows users to modify such features as colors, positioning, line
sizes, lighting, etc. without having to remake scripts.
 <P>

The next step is to set up the frame changes for the animation.  We
will require three fields: one to modify surface topography, one to
modify surface color, and one to modify the sites source file.  For
the sake of brevity, our animation will only be five frames long.  We
can create the field changes as follows:
 <P>

<OL>
<LI> Load the script tools by selecting <I>Script Tools</I> under the
<I>Scripting</I> menu.
<LI> Press the <I>File Sequence Tool</I> button on the script tools
popup.
<LI> Press the <I>Add</I> button under <I>Fields:</I> in the <I>File
Sequence Tool</I>.
<LI> Be sure that <I>Field Type:</I> is set to <I>Surface</I>,
<I>Field Attribute:</I> is set to <I>Topography</I> and <I>Set
From:</I> is set to "y90o.1@helena", then press <I>Accept</I>.
<LI> In the file browser popup, select the sequence of files:
<UL>
<LI> y90o.1@helena
<LI> y90o.2@helena
<LI> y90o.3@helena
<LI> y90o.4@helena
<LI> y90o.5@helena
</UL>
and click <I>Done</I>.
<LI> We have just created the five frame changes for the topography
attribute.  Repeat steps 4 and 5 except set <I>Field Attribute:</I> to
<I>Color</I>.  This creates the five frame changes for the color attribute.
<LI> Repeat steps 4 and 5 except set <I>Field Type:</I> to <I>Site</I>.
In the file browser popup , select the sequence of files:
<UL>
<LI> y90mo.1@helena
<LI> y90mo.2@helena
<LI> y90mo.3@helena
<LI> y90mo.4@helena
<LI> y90mo.5@helena
</UL>
<LI> Finally, set the state file to the file you saved in state
creation above.  State file is set by pressing the <I>State File:</I>
button under <I>Fields:</I>.
</OL>
 <P>

At this point, the <I>File Sequence Tool</I> display should look
something like the following:
 <P>

<H5>
<IMG SRC="nvimg/work/FSToolExample.gif">
File Sequence Tool Example</H5>
 <P>

It may be wise to save your progress up to this point by clicking
<I>Save Fields...</I> and choosing an appropriate file name.  Saving
the fields configuration is also a convenient way to use the same
state file with different fields settings.  For example, we could
later modify our fields settings above by changing the list of files
used in the frame sequence, adding new fields, etc.
 <P>

Since we are generating a stand-alone script, press the <I>Build
Script...</I> button and choose an appropriate file name for the new
script.  We will now edit the script so that it will render each frame
after the field changes have been made.  Load the script file into
your favorite editor and do the following:
 <P>

<OL>
<LI> Find the line with the comment "# Put image saving code here".
It is after this line that we will add commands to render frames.
<LI> Add the following four lines after the comment <B>exactly</B> as
they appear here:
<PRE>
     SendScriptLine "Nsurf_draw_all"
     SendScriptLine "Nvect_draw_all"
     SendScriptLine "Nsite_draw_all"
     after 1000
</PRE>
<LI> Re-save the script file.
</OL>
 <P>

The four lines we have added are instructions to Nviz to render the
all surface, vector and site files, then wait approximately one second
before going on to the next frame.  The <I>SendScriptLine</I> command
is described in the next section.  At this point, the script is purely
stand-alone and can be played from within nviz.  To play the script
select <I>Play Script</I> from the <I>Scripting</I> menu and choose
the script file you saved above.  After a brief bit of initialization,
the script will execute the field changes we specified above.
