<H3>NVIZ - What's Here</H3>
</A> <P>

The <A HREF="#WhatsP">What's Here</A> panel operates like the
<strong>GRASS</em></strong> program <em>d.what.rast</em></strong>, you
use the mouse to mark spots on the surface that you would like more
information about.  After clicking on the surface, data prints to the
text box in the panel.  First, the name of the surface clicked on is
printed then the geographical coordinates.  Next, elevation is
bi-linearly interpolated from the current polygon resolution and this
is printed (setting the resolution to 1 will produce the most accurate
elevation). xy distance from previous and xyz distance from previous
are straight line distances, whereas distance along surface and
distance along exag surface are computed as the length of a path
draped across the surface.  Each time you select a point, a marker is
drawn on the surface at the point selected with a line connecting it
to the previous point.  To stop selecting points toggle the
<strong>What's here?</em></strong> button.  <p>
