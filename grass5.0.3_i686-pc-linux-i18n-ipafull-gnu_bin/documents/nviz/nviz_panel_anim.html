<h3>NVIZ - Basic Animation</h3>
</A> <P>

Use the <A HREF="#AnimP">Animation</A> panel to create simple fly-bys
of surfaces.  <P>

<strong>step, run, Key Frames:</em></strong> The
<em>Frames</em></strong> slider may be thought of as a time line
representing the path.  When a path has been loaded, clicking on
<em>run</em></strong> will move the viewer down the path, redrawing
the wire frame surface at each path step.  The user may cancel a
running animation at any time by clicking on the
<em>stop</em></strong> button.  The <em>Key Frames</em></strong>
slider shows the progression of the animation.  Use the
<em>step</em></strong> arrows to step forward or backward one frame at
a time, or move the <em>Key Frames</em></strong> slider to the desired
point in the animation.  The number to the right of the
<em>step</em></strong> arrows is the frame number being displayed. <p>

<strong>total frames:</em></strong> The value in this type-in box is
the total number of frames in the animation.  When a vector file is
first loaded, the number of points in the file (up to 1000) will be
the number of frames.  Typically, to produce smooth animations, the
user should use a vector file with 10 - 50 points, then change total
frames to 100 or more, depending on the length of the animation
desired. Requesting an excessive number of frames (i.e., 500,000) may
cause memory problems.  <p>

<strong>show path:</em></strong> Toggling this button ON will cause
the path to be drawn each time a new frame is drawn.  The color and
thickness of the path line may be changed using adjustments on the
<strong>Vectors</em></strong> pop up panel.  Showing the path can be
useful while previewing and adjusting the path.  <p>

<strong>show vect:</em></strong> Toggling this button ON will cause
vectors to be drawn each time a new frame is drawn, if a vector file
has been loaded. (see also <em>Vect...</em></strong>).  <p>

<strong>spline, linear, tension:</em></strong> These controls affect
the interpolation method used when the value of <em>total
frames</em></strong> is different than the number of points in the
original vector file used as the path.  The points from the vector
file are always used as control points from which the positioning
information for the total number of requested frames is derived.  If
<em>spline</em></strong> interpolation is selected, the user may
adjust spline tension (how much slack there is in the path) using the
<em>tension</em></strong> slider.  Toggling <em>show
path</em></strong> ON prior to adjusting tension allows the user to
judge how much tension to use for a smoother path.  <p>

<A NAME="Rsavev"></A> <strong>run and save images:</em></strong>
Prompts user in the <strong>GRASS</em></strong> window for a prefix to
be used to name a series of rgb format image files, one for each
frame.  The animation is then run from the beginning, with each frame
being fully rendered using the current display type and resolution
(see <strong><A HREF="#Ctrlp">Control</A></em></strong> panel).  If
<em>show vect</em></strong> is toggled ON, the vector file is also
drawn, then the finished frame is written to an rgb file. If files
already exist with the same name, they are overwritten.  You may
cancel <em>run and save images</em></strong> at any time by selecting
<em>stop</em></strong> This entire process may take several hours of
computer time for a 100 frame animation of a complex surface, but
requires no further intervention from the user.  The finished rendered
animation files can be played back using SGI's <em>movie</em></strong>
program if it is a very short animation or you can capture the images
on video (Also see <em><A HREF="#Idump">Img Dump</A></em></strong>).
