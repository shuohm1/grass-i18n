<H3>NVIZ - Nviz State</H3>
</A> <P>

It is often desirable and convenient to save some configuration of
Nviz for use in other applications.  For example, each session of Nviz
might require the same set of maps or other attributes.  To allow
persistence between sessions, Nviz provides tools for saving and
loading the current "state" of the system.  These tools are accessed
using the <I>Load State</I> and <I>Save State</I> options under the
<I>File</I> menu.  <P>

<I>Save State</I> records the current status of Nviz, including all
current maps, color settings, camera viewpoint, and so on into a user
designated file.  This state file may then be reloaded at a later time
and will restore the state of Nviz.  <I>Load State</I> queries the
user for a state file to load and modifies the state of Nviz according
to the state file.  Note that <I>Load State</I> does not erase the
current state of Nviz when loading a new state.  Instead, the current
state is augmented according to the contents of the state file.  Since
this can sometimes cause unexpected results, it is best to either
restart Nviz or manually reset the state of Nviz before loading a
state file.  <P>

State files are particularly useful when creating scripts for animation
(see <A HREF="#ScriptingP">scripting</A> below).  In particular, a
predefined Nviz state can be loaded automatically into a script by
turning on scripting and performing the activity of loading the new
state.  <P>
