<h3>NVIZ - Movement</h3>
</A><p>

<em>nviz</em></strong> starts up with one graphics window and one
control panel window.  The top third of the control panel window
contains the <a href="#MovementP"> Movement </a> panel.  Other panels
may be selected from the <em>Panel</em></strong> menu at the top of
the window. When a panel is selected it appears in the control panel
window.  If the window is full, and there is no room for the new
panel, one or more panels that are open on the control panel window
will be closed to make room for the new panel.  Panels can also be
closed using the <em>Close</em></strong> button that appears on each
panel.  The <em>Movement panel</em>, however is always visible. Each
panel from the <em>Panel</em></strong> menu will be described in more
detail below.  <p>

<IMG SRC="nvimg/panel/main.gif" ALT = ""> <A name="MovementP">Movement Panel</A>
</h3><p>

Use the <strong>Movement</em></strong> panel to position the viewer
over the data and to indicate viewing direction and perspective.  As
options in this panel are changed, a wire grid of the surface is
redrawn (<em>fast display mode</em></strong>) to immediately show the
results of the changes.  This panel also controls the actual drawing.
 <P>

<DL>
<DT> <B>Auto Clear</B>
<DD> This is a toggle button. If it is enabled
the screen is automatically cleared before surfaces are drawn.  <P>

<DT> <B>Clear</B>
<DD> Clears the screen with the background color.  <P>


<DT> <B>Surface</B>
<DD> Draws loaded surfaces with current drawing
and lighting options.  <P>

<DT> <B>Vectors</B>
<DD> Draws loaded vector files on selected
surfaces.  <P>

<DT> <B>Sites</B>
<DD> Draws loaded site files on selected surfaces.
<P>

<DT> <B>Cancel</B>
<DD> Cancels drawing in progress.  <p>

<DT> <B>XY position</B>
<DD> The <em>XY position</em></strong> box contains a star-shaped puck
which represents the viewer.  Click on the puck and drag to move the
viewer around.  The data may be thought of as always lying in the
center of the box, with north at the top. <p>

<DT> <B>Height</B>
<DD> Adjusts the viewer's height.  <p>

<DT> <B>look here</B>
<DD> Allows the user to click on a spot on the data surface which will
remain centered as the viewer position changes.  After clicking on the
surface, the new center is automatically set and the surface is
redrawn.  <p>

<DT> <B>look center</B>
<DD> Automatically fixes new center of view at the <em>center of the
graphics window</em></strong> (not the center of the data).  <p>

<DT> <B>look cancel</B>
<DD> Clicking on <em>cancel</em></strong> allows the user to move over
the surface with no fixed center of view (default).  <p>

<DT> <B>zexag</B>
<DD> Exaggerates the vertical dimension of the surface.  An
exaggeration of 1.0 represents the surface with x, y, and z units all
being equal.  For example, if the easting and northing units are in
meters and the elevation in feet, a Z exaggeration of .305 would be
the <em>true</em></strong> exaggeration for the surface.  For most
geographical applications, greater than true exaggeration produces
more visually pleasing images.  <p>

<DT> <B>Perspective</B>
<DD> Adjusts the viewer's angle of view.  <p>

<DT> <B>Reset</B>
<DD> Sets all settings to their startup values.  <p>

</DL>
<P>

Occasionally, the bounds of the <B>height</B> slider are too narrow to
position the camera as desired.  In this case, the type-in entry next
to the height slider may be used to set camera height directly.
Typing in a value will also automatically adjust the slider bounds to
account for the new maximum and minimum height.  In general, most
sliders with corresponding type-ins provide this functionality where
it makes sense.  Color sliders, for example, cannot be adjusted since
color components must always be between 0.0 and 1.0.
