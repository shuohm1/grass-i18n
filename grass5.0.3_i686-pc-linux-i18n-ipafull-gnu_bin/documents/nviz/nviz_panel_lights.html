<h3>NVIZ - Lights</h3>
</A> <P>

The <A HREF="#LightP">Lights</A> panel contains adjustments and
options to control the position, color and brightness of the lights
and the reflectivity (shininess) of the surface.  There are actually
two lights: one dim white light remains directly above the surface at
all times and serves as fill light. The main light, which the user
controls, is a "local" light which is positioned much like the view
position.  When lights are being adjusted, a sphere appears on the
surface and is continuously redrawn to show the effects of lighting
changes.  The lighting adjustments do not affect the appearance of the
surface until it is redrawn.  Neither light is directional; light is
emitted equally in all directions.  <p>

<DT> <B>Follow Viewpoint</B>
<DD> By default, the light position is near the viewing position and
the light moves with the viewer.  Toggling this option off will keep
the light fixed in one position as the viewer position changes.
Adjusting the <em>Height</em></strong> or <em>XY
position</em></strong> of the light automatically toggles <em>Follow
Viewpoint</em></strong> off.  <p>

<DT> <B>Show Model</B>
<DD> The sphere showing current lighting effects can be removed by
toggling this option off.  <p>

<DT> <B>Height</B>
