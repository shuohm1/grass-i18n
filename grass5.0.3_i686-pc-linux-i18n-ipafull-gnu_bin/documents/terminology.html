<h1>
GRASS 5 Terminology</h1>

<P>
LOCATION: This is the name of an available geographic location. 

<P>
MAPSET:   Every GRASS session runs under the name of a MAPSET. A MAPSET may
          be a geographical subset or as large as the parent LOCATION. 
          Technically they are subdirectories under any location. In a
          networked environment with several users working within the same
          location, mapsets play a special role. Users may only select (and
          thus modify) a mapset that they own (i.e., have created). However,
          data in all mapsets for a given location can be read by anyone
          (unless prevented by UNIX file permissions). The "PERMANENT"
          mapset usually contains the read-only base maps like the elevation
          model, while the other locations are readable and writable by
          their owners. The "PERMANENT" mapset also contains some
          information about the location itself that is not found in other
          mapsets (projection info etc.), thus it must exist in every
          location.

<P>
DATABASE: This is the unix directory containing the geographic LOCATIONS
          (also called GISDBASE)

<P> 
REGION: The REGION may be the entire area or subset of the chosen
        LOCATION.

<P>
WINDOW: see REGION

<P>
CELL DATA TYPE: a raster map from INTEGER type (whole numbers only)

<P>
FCELL DATA TYPE: a raster map from FLOAT type (4 bytes, 6 digits precision)

<P>
DCELL DATA TYPE: a raster map from DOUBLE type (8 bytes, 10 digits precision)

<P>
NULL: represents "no data" in raster maps, to be distinguished from 0 (zero)
      data value

<P>
INTEGER MAP: see CELL DATA TYPE

<P>
FLOAT MAP: see FCELL DATA TYPE

<P>
DOUBLE MAP: see DCELL DATA TYPE

<hr>
<P>
CATEGORY NUMBER: A numerical value for a map feature (e.g. road number).
    Also sometimes called CATEGORY VALUE.

<P>
CATEGORY LABEL: A text attribute for a map feature (e.g. road name).
<P>
Both CATEGORY NUMBER and CATEGORY LABEL are related to the dig_cats/ file.
The internal vector ID is different from this.

<p><pre>
Inofficial proposal for 5.1 (to be discussed):

   Since there is some confusion about the term "category numbers" and 
   "category labels", there is the suggestion to change these two terms 
   to common GIS vocabulary for GRASS 5.1: 

         5.0              5.1 
    category number  ->  index           # numeric
    category label   ->  attribute       # text
</pre>
