<H2>NAME</H2>

<EM><b>d.igraph</b></EM>  - Graphics interface for GRASS on the
Intergraph.

<BR>

<EM>(Map Development Tool)</EM>

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>d.igraph</B>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>d.igraph</EM> is the GRASS interface to the GRASS
graphics driver on the Intergraph workstations.  GRASS can
be run from an ascii terminal or from a window on the
Intergraph workstation.  There are some pitfalls to running
GRASS from a window; these are discussed in the NOTES
section below.

<P>

When <EM>d.igraph</EM> is run a pull-down menu will appear
on the workstation screen and some information will be
displayed on the ascii terminal.  The pull-down menu, which
works the same way other Intergraph pull down-menus work,
will look like this:

<PRE>
  _______________________
  |  GRASS Commands      |
  |  start/select        |
  |  stop                |
  |  GRASS Graphics      |
  |  resize/move         |
  |  virtual screens    &gt;|
  |  colors             &gt;|
  | EXIT                 |
  |______________________|
</PRE>

The menu is divided into two categories: <EM>GRASS
Commands</EM> and <EM>GRASS Graphics</EM>.  <EM>GRASS
Commands</EM> in the pull-down menu have GRASS command-line
equivalents. These command-line equivalents can be used
without running <EM>d.igraph</EM>, although users may find
the pull-down menu commands easier and faster to use.  On
the other hand, there are no command-line equivalents for
the <EM>GRASS Graphics</EM> commands in the pull-down
menu.  These commands, which must be run from inside
<EM>d.igraph</EM>, enable you to modify the size,
placement, and number of colors, of the graphics window.

<P>

The first command under <EM>GRASS Commands</EM> is
<EM>start/select</EM>; selecting this command with the
mouse will start the graphics driver <EM>IGRAPH</EM> and
then select it for output.  This pull-down menu command is
equivalent to typing the following commands at the GRASS
command line:

<DL>
<DT><B>d.mon start=IGRAPH</B>  
<DD>(start and select the IGRAPH graphics driver)
</DL>

or

<DL>
<DT><B>d.mon -s start=IGRAPH </B>
<DD>(start but don't select the IGRAPH driver)
<DT><B>d.mon select=IGRAPH </B>
<DD>(select the already started IGRAPH driver)
</DL>


Using the <EM>start/select</EM> option saves the user from
having to type the above command(s).  After the graphics
driver is started, the pull-down menu will disappear and
the <EM>d.igraph</EM> program will exit, leaving the user
at the GRASS prompt.  When the second command
(<EM>stop</EM>) under <EM>GRASS Commands</EM> is selected,
the graphics driver <EM>IGRAPH</EM> will stop and the GRASS
window will disappear.  The equivalent GRASS command-line
command is: <B>d.mon stop=IGRAPH</B>.


<P>

The second category (<EM>GRASS Graphics</EM>) in the
pull-down menu contains three commands written for the
GRASS graphics driver <EM>IGRAPH</EM>.  These commands
establish parameters for size, location, and number of
colors the graphics driver will use to create a GRASS
graphics window. Therefore, they should be run
<EM>before</EM> starting the graphics driver with the
<EM>start/select</EM> command.  These parameters will not
affect a GRASS window that has already been started, but
they will be saved and used the next time the graphics
driver is started.

<P>

The first command in the second category is
<EM>resize/move</EM>.  When the <EM>resize/move</EM>
command is selected, the pull-down menu will disappear and
a special <EM>Resize</EM> window, colored grey, will be
created on the graphics monitor.  The <EM>Resize</EM>
window will be the exact size and at the same location as
the GRASS graphics window would be if the graphics driver
had been started.  Use the resize and move icons on the
<EM>Resize</EM> window to modify the window.  When the
desired size and position has been achieved, <B>delete</B>
the <EM>Resize</EM> window.  To do this, move the mouse to
the left side of the icon strip at the top of the
<EM>Resize</EM> window and click the mouse on the small
box  containing an <B>X</B>.  Note that the window size is
displayed on the ascii terminal in which the
<EM>d.igraph</EM> program was started.  Now, each time the
graphics monitor is started, the window will be the same
size and at the same location as the <EM>Resize</EM>
window.

<P>

The second command is <EM>virtual screens</EM>.  This
command has a sub-menu with a listing of virtual screen
numbers (from 0 to 3).  Of the virtual screen numbers
listed (0 to 3), only one or two of those numbers will be
active and selectable from the sub-menu.  The number of
selectable virtual screen numbers will depend on the type
of workstation and its virtual screen configuration.  When
the <EM>IGRAPH</EM> driver is started, it will create a
GRASS window on the virtual screen whose number was picked
by this command.  Note that the current virtual screen
number is displayed on the ascii terminal n which the
<EM>d.igraph</EM> program was started.

<P>

The third graphics command is <EM>colors</EM>.  This
command has a sub-menu with a listing of the possible range
of active colors the workstations will support (16 to
512).  The number of active colors is determined by the
number of planes the graphics processor supports  (9 planes
will give 512 active colors).  We do not suggest running
GRASS with fewer than <B>256</B> active colors.

<P>

Each workstation can be configured differently with regard
to the number of virtual screens and the available number
of colors.  A certain amount of testing will have to been
done to determine what works best with a particular
workstation.

<P>

The last command is the <EM>EXIT</EM> command.  This
command is used to leave the <EM>d.igraph</EM> program.


<H2>USING THE GRAPHICS WINDOW</H2>

Once the GRASS graphics driver is started, a window will
appear on the screen.  The GRASS graphics window is
mouse-activated.  The mouse must be within the GRASS
graphics window for the true GRASS colors to be displayed
on the graphics window.  The mouse doesn't have to be
clicked inside the window; just moving the mouse within the
window is enough to activate the window.  While the mouse
is outside the GRASS graphics window, the colors in the
graphics window will be random.

<H2>NOTES</H2>

Obsolete for LINUX, of course!
<P>
When using the GRASS program <EM>d.colors</EM> or the
<EM>interact</EM> selection in the <EM>d.display</EM>
program, the mouse must be within the GRASS graphics window
when toggling or highlighting categories.  If the mouse is
not within the graphics window, the colors will not
represent the true category colors.  Using the two programs
mentioned above while running GRASS from an Intergraph
window (ascii window) creates a problem; The mouse must be
within the graphics window at all times for those programs
to work properly, but the mouse also must be moved to the
ascii window to activate the ascii window so that commands
can be typed.  This is not a problem when GRASS is run from
an ascii terminal, because the mouse can be left within the
GRASS graphics window at all times.
