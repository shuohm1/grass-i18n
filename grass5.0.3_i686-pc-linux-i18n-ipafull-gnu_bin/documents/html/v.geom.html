<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>v.geom</EM> takes a vector file as input and computes
various triangulations respecting the input edges, or the
convex hull of the sites. The z-coordinate is read from the
description field if it is specified, otherwise 0 is
assumed. The z-coordinate is used for the MinMax-slope
triangulation.  For all other computations the z-coordinate
is ignored.


<P>

The MinMax-angle triangulation is the triangulation for the
sites which minmizes (lexicographically) the sorted vector
of all the angles of triangles in the triangulation. The
constrained version also minimizes this vector but under
the constrained that prescribed (i.e. input) edges are part
of the final triangulation.  The MaxMin-height and
MinMax-slope triangulations are similar.  The algorithms
used for the computations are not heuristics, they actually
achieve the optimum.


<P>

We use a simple extension of the algorithm used to compute
the Delaunay triangulation in 

<EM><A HREF="../html/s.geom.html">s.geom</A></EM> to

compute a triangulation which can be considered an
approximatoin of the constrained Delaunay triangulation.
However, this is only a (bad?) heuristic.

<P>

The output is saved in vector file format. Edge labels of
input edges will also be attached to the corresponding
output edges.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<H3>Parameters:</H3>

<DL>
<DT><B>input=</B><EM>name</EM>
<DD>Input vector (level 2) file.

<DT><B>output=</B><EM>name</EM>
<DD>Output vector file.

<DT><B>precision=</B><EM>value</EM>
<DD>Number of significant positions after the decimal point. (default is 0).

<DT><B>operation=</B><EM>name</EM>
<DD>One of the following: <EM>sweep</EM>,
<EM>delaunay</EM>, <EM>angle</EM>, <EM>height</EM>,
<EM>slope</EM>, <EM>hull</EM>. These correspond to the
constrained planesweep triangulation, constrained Delaunay
heuristic, constrained MinMax-angle triangulation,
constrained MaxMin-height triangulation, constrained
MinMax-slope triangulation, and convex hull, respectively.
(default is constrained planesweep triangulation).

<H2>NOTE</H2>

The computation times for the various operations depends
strongly on the algorithm used.

<P>

The plansweep triangulation and convex hull computation
require <EM>O(n log n)</EM> operations in the worst case
[<A HREF="#Ed">Ed</A>].  The Delaunay heuristic needs
<EM>O(n^2)</EM> time in the worst case, however it performs
much faster in practice. The MinMax-angle and MaxMin-height
triangulations need <EM>O(n^2 log n)</EM> operations
[<A HREF="#BeEd">BeEd</A>, <A HREF="#EdTa">EdTa</A>], and the
MinMax-slope triangulation needs <EM>O(n^3)</EM> operations
[<A HREF="#BeEd">BeEd</A>].

<P>

Internally, the coordinates of the sites are stored in
fix-point format.  Therefore, the number of decimal digits
cannot exceed 64 bit (or approx.  16 decimal digits).

<P>

It is important that the input vector file is reasonably
"clean". The current implementation of <EM>v.geom</EM>
takes care of loops (i.e. zero length edges), duplicate
edges, and edges which are collinear and overlapping.
However, because of the internal representation of
coordinates in fix-point format it can happen that certain
anomalies are introduced.  For examples edges can cross
although they don't in the input data.  Currently, the
program does not test for such cases. If it occures one of
two situations will happen. Either, the planesweep
algorithm terminates with a segmentation fault, or it will
loop forever. For the data where we had problems these
problems could be eliminated if we first used

<H2>BUGS</H2>

Some fields of the header in the output file are not
properly set.
