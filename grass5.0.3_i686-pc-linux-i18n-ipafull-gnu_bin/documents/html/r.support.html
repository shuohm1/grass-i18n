<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The GRASS program <EM>r.support</EM> 
allows the user to create and/or modify raster map layer support files. 
It may be run only on raster map layers in the user's current mapset. 

<P> Most options have to be used interactively, so the user runs the program
by typing <B>r.support</B>, and will be queried for inputs.

<P>
Various GRASS programs depend on one or more of the following 
GRASS <EM>support</EM> files: 

<DL>
<DT><B>cellhd</B>
<DD>The cell header file contains information on a map's projection, zone, 
regional boundaries, row and column totals, cell resolution, storage format, 
and compression. 
It describes where and how this map's raster (cell) data fits in with reference 
to other raster map layers' data. 
Without it, the raster map layer could not be displayed or analyzed properly. 
Using <EM>r.support</EM>, the user can change the 
# of columns, # of bytes per cell, 
and default geographic region settings. 
Generally, users would not change this information. 
Cell header files are stored under the <EM>cellhd</EM> directory under 
the user's current mapset. 

<DT><B>stats</B>
<DD>Raster map layer statistics are saved in the form of a histogram and 
range of the category values which occur in the map layer. 
Statistics files are stored in subdirectories of the 
<EM>cell_misc</EM> directory under the user's current mapset.  This option
is (currently) the only option which can be used on command line (-r flag).

<DT><B>cats</B>
<DD>A category file associates each category value in the raster map layer 
with a category description (label). 
The user may add or edit the category descriptions, 
alter the number of categories, and add or alter the map's TITLE. 
Category files associated with raster map layers are stored under the 
<EM>cats</EM> directory in the user's current mapset. 

<DT><B>colr</B>
<DD>A color file associates each category 
value in the raster map layer with a color. 
Using <EM>r.support</EM>, the user may assign one of eight color table types 
to the raster map layer. 
Map color table files are stored under the 
<EM>colr</EM> and <EM>colr2</EM> directories 
under the user's current mapset. 

<DT><B>hist</B>
<DD>Historical information about the raster map layer is 
stored in a history file. 
The user may add or edit the raster map's TITLE, data type, data source, data 
description, and include comments. 
(Note that the specification of map data type here is somewhat archaic, 
and should always be set to <EM>raster</EM>.)
Map history files are stored under the <EM>hist</EM> directory under 
the user's current mapset. 

</DL>

<H2>NOTES</H2>

The <EM>r.support</EM> program attempts to verify that the information 
in the cell header is reasonable. The data format specified in the header 
is verified against the raster map layer itself. This includes checking 
that files which the header indicates are <EM>compressed</EM> are really 
compressed, and that the number of rows and columns specified 
in the header correspond to the actual file size. 

<P>

The <EM>r.support</EM> program can also be used to determine the number 
of columns and rows of data in a raster map layer, 
in the event that no cell header is available. 
This is useful, for example, for importing raster map layers created 
by software other than GRASS. 

<P>

If the file is not compressed, the file size should be the product of the 
number of rows and columns. 
If the file is compressed, this test cannot be performed since the 
file size will bear no relation to the product. The number 
of rows can still be verified, but the number of columns cannot. 

<P>
To compute or correct the <EM>stats</EM>, the cell header must be correct, 
since the raster map layer is read to determine the stats. 

<P>

If a new <EM>cats</EM> or <EM>colr</EM> 
(or <EM>colr2</EM>) file is required, the 
<EM>stats</EM> must be correct. 

<P>

The user is allowed to change the number of categories 
specified in the category file. This should <B>only</B> be done if the 
user knows that the maximum category value in the raster map layer 
is different than that which is recorded in the category file. 
Changing the category value in the <EM>cats</EM> file allows 
the user to add more category labels, or to remove labels. It does 
NOT change the category values in the raster map layer itself. 

<P>

The color file is unique among GRASS support files. 
While it is necessary to protect a user's original data from being modified 
by users working under other mapsets, 
these users need to be able to create color tables for maps that are stored 
under mapsets other than their own. 
Color table files meet both these objectives. 

<P>
Color table files get stored in one of two directories, both under the user's 
current mapset. The color files created by a user for raster maps stored under 
that user's current mapset get stored in the directory <EM>$LOCATION/colr</EM> 
and cannot be modified or removed by other users. 
The color table files that the user modifies/creates 
for raster map layers <EM>not</EM> stored under the user's current mapset 
get stored in a <EM>secondary color</EM> file under the user's mapset. 
This secondary color table is stored under $LOCATION/colr2/&lt;mapset&gt;
where &lt;mapset&gt; is the name of the mapset under which the raster 
map data are stored. 
In versions of GRASS prior to 3.0, this was also the case for 
color tables in the user's own mapset. Now, however, if a user modifies 
a color table associated with a raster map layer in his own current mapset, 
these changes will be made to the user's original color file 
(i.e., the user's color changes will overwrite whatever previous color 
table file 
existed for this map under the user's $LOCATION/colr directory). 
No secondary color files are created for raster map layers stored in the 
user's own mapset. 

<H2>WARNING</H2>

In order to modify the <EM>cell header</EM>,
the raster (cell) map layer under consideration must <EM>not</EM> be a 
<EM>reclass</EM>
file. This is because the <EM>reclass</EM> file's header does not 
contain positional information, 
but rather a reference to another raster map layer. Thus it shares 
a cell header with the referenced raster map layer. 
In order to change the cell header, <EM>r.support</EM> must be run on the 
true raster file referenced.
