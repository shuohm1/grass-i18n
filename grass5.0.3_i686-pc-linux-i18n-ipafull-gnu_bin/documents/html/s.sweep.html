<H2>NAME</H2>
<EM><B>s.sweep</B></EM> - computes Voronoi diagram or Delaunay triangulation
(used by s.voronoi and s.delaunay)

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>
<B>s.sweep [-dstp]</B>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
       s.sweep reads the standard input for a set  of  points  in
       the  plane  and  writes  either the Voronoi diagram or the
       Delaunay triangulation to the standard output.  Each input
       line  should  consist  of  two  real numbers, separated by
       white space.

       The program is used by s.voronoi and s.delaunay and is not
       meant to be useful as a standalone program.

       If  option  -t  is  present, the Delaunay triangulation is
       produced.  Each output line is a triple i j k,  which  are
       the  indices  of  the three points in a Delaunay triangle.
       Points are numbered starting at 0.

       If option -t is not present, the Voronoi diagram  is  
       produced.  There are four output record types.

<pre>
       s a b  indicates  that  an  input point at coordinates a b
              was seen.

       l a b c
              indicates a line with equation ax + by = c.

       v a b  indicates a vertex at a b.

       e l v1 v2
              indicates a Voronoi segment which is  a  subsegment
              of line number l with endpoints numbered v1 and v2.
              If v1 or v2 is -1, the line extends to infinity.
</pre>

       The other options are:

<pre>
       s      The input is sorted by  y  coordinate  (the  second
              number  in  the pair).  The first input line should
              be npoints xmin xmax ymin ymax.  This describes the
              number of points and the range of the points.  This
              line is used to determine internal hash table size;
              it  need not be exact but performance suffers if it
              is grossly wrong.

       p      Produce output suitable  for  input  to  plot  (1),
              rather than the forms described above.
</pre>

       On unsorted data uniformly distributed in the unit square,
       s.sweep uses about 20n+140/n bytes of storage.  On sorted
       data, s.sweep uses about 160/n bytes.
