<H2>NAME</H2>

<EM><b>d.measure</b></EM> - Measures the lengths and areas of features 
drawn by the user in the active display frame on the graphics monitor.

<EM>(GRASS Display Program)</EM>

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>d.measure</B>

[<B>c2=</B><EM>name</EM>] 

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>d.measure</EM> provides the user with an interactive
way to measure the lengths and areas of lines and polygons
drawn by the user in the active frame on the graphics
monitor.  Lines and polygons are drawn using a pointing
device (mouse).  Each line segment is drawn in colors
<EM>c1</EM> and <EM>c2</EM>.  A mouse button menu indicates
that the user can find out the geographic coordinates of
the cursor location, draw line segments between
user-specified vertices, and quit <EM>d.measure</EM>. Lines
and polygons are defined by the series of vertices marked
by the user. If more than two successive vertices are
drawn, <EM>d.measure</EM> prints the area encompassed
(<EM>d.measure</EM> will assume the area is closed even if
the user has not joined the first and last vertices).  Line
lengths are stated in the same units as those of the
current LOCATION. In a XY-LOCATION, where no units are
 available, <EM>d.measure</EM> prints a warning and gives results
  without units.  Areas are stated in hectares, square
miles, square meters and square kilometers.

Lines and polygons drawn using <EM>d.measure</EM> will
overlay (not overwrite) whatever display currently appears
in the active frame on the graphics monitor.  The user can,
for example, run 
<EM><A HREF="d.rast.html">d.rast</A></EM> or 
<EM><A HREF="d.vect.html">d.vect</A></EM> prior to running
<EM>d.measure</EM>, and use raster and/or vector maps
as a backdrop.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

The user can specify the colors in which line segments will
be drawn by setting the values of <EM>c1</EM> and
<EM>c2</EM> on the command line.  Default line colors (see
below) will be used if the user does not specify the values
of <EM>c1</EM> and <EM>c2</EM> on the command line.

<H3>Flags</H3>

<DL>
<DT><B>-s</B>
<DD>Suppesses clear screen and writes messages to stderr instead of stdout. Usefull for work with the TCLTKGRASS gui.

<DT><B>-m</B>
<DD>Use metric units (meters, kilometers) only

<DT><B>-k</B>
<DD>Output results (additionally) in kilometers and square kilometers

</DL>

<H3>Parameters:</H3>

<DL>
<DT><B>c1=</B><EM>name</EM>
<DD>The first color in which each line segment is drawn, 
    while being positioned. 
<BR>
    Options: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, magenta, brown, 
    gray, white, and black 
<BR>
    Default: <EM>white</EM> 
<DT><B>c2=</B><EM>name</EM>
<DD>The second color in which each line segment is drawn, 
    after its vertices are fixed. 
    Options: Same as <EM>c1</EM>.
<BR>
    Default: <EM>white</EM> 
</DL>

<H2>NOTES</H2>

<EM>d.measure</EM> uses all segments drawn by the user when computing area. 
If the user draws an area within another area, the combined 
area of both regions will be output.
