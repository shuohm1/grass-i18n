<H2>NAME</H2>

<EM><b>r.grow</b></EM>  - Generates an output raster map layer 
with contiguous areas grown by one cell (pixel). 
<BR>
<EM>(GRASS Raster Program)</EM>

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>r.grow</B> 
<BR>
<B>r.grow help</B> 
<BR>
<B>r.grow</B> [<B>-bq</B>] <B>input=</B><EM>name</EM> 
<B>output=</B><EM>name</EM> 

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>r.grow</EM>
adds one cell around the perimeters of all areas in a user-specified raster 
map layer and stores the output in a new raster map layer. 

<P>

An area consists of any contiguous clump of cells with
non-zero category values. No distinction is made between
differing category values within an area. Rather, a border
is grown around the outside of each entire contiguous set
of non-zero cells.

<P>

The <B>output</B> raster map layer will not go outside
the boundaries set in the current geographic region.  Thus,
if a contiguous area in the <B>input</B> raster map layer
extends to the geographic edge of the current map layer, no
new border cells can be added to that side of the area.

<P>
Growth around a rectangular area in the <B>input</B> raster map layer will 
occur straight out from each edge, but not diagonally 
from the corners of the rectangle. Thus, the "grown" 
border area will contain lines along the edge of the 
original rectangle, but the corners of the border will not be squared off. 
Instead, the lines 
of the border which go along each side of the original rectangle 
will touch only at the corners of the cells at the end of each line. 

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

The user can run <EM>r.grow</EM> either interactively or non-interactively. 
The program is run interactively if the user types <B>r.grow</B> without 
specifying flag settings and parameter values on the command line. 
In this case, the user will be prompted for input. 

<P>
Alternately, the user can run <EM>r.grow</EM> non-interactively, by 
specifying the names of an <B>input</B> and <B>output</B> map layer, 
and including any desired flags, on the command line. 


<P>

<H3>Flags:</H3>

<DL>
<DT><B>-b</B>
<DD>Output a binary raster map layer having only zero-one category values, 
regardless of the category values in the <B>input</B> map layer. 
In this case, all cells with a non-zero category value in the <B>input</B> map 
layer are assigned to category 1 in the <B>output</B> map layer. 
If the -b flag is not used, these cells will retain their original 
non-zero category values. In either case, all cells 
whose category value is changed from 0 during the growing 
process are assigned a category value of 1 in the <B>output</B> map. 
<DT><B>-q</B>
<DD>Run quietly, supressing printing of information about program progress 
to standard output. 
</DL>

<P>

<H3>Parameters:</H3>

<DL>
<DT><B>input=</B><EM>name</EM>

<DD>Name of an existing raster map layer in the user's
current mapset search path containing areas to be "grown".

<DT><B>output=</B><EM>name</EM>

<DD>Name of the new raster map layer to contain program
output.  This map will be binary if the user sets the -b
flag. Otherwise, <B>input</B> map cells having non-zero
category values will retain their original values.  In
either case, all cells whose values changed during growth
will be assigned category value 1 in the <B>output</B>
map.

</DL>

<H2>NOTES</H2>

The <EM>r.grow</EM> command can be used to represent the
boundary of one or more areas. In this case, the zero-one
(binary) output option should NOT be used. Then the
<B>input</B> map layer can be subtracted from the
<B>output</B> map layer using the
<EM><A HREF="r.mapcalc.html">r.mapcalc</A></EM> command. 
All original non-zero category values will be subtracted
out, leaving the boundary areas only. This resulting
zero-one boundary depiction can be displayed over other
related raster map layers using the overlay option of
<EM><A HREF="d.rast.html">d.rast</A></EM>.

<P>

If the resolution of the current geographic region does not
agree with the resolution of the input raster map layer,
unintended resampling of the original raster map layer may
occur.  The user should be sure that the current geographic
region is set properly.
