<H2>NAME</H2>

<EM><b>r.weight</b></EM>  - Raster map overlay program.

<BR>

<EM>(GRASS Raster Program)</EM>

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>r.weight</B>

<BR>


<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>r.weight</EM> is a language driven raster map overlay
program.  It provides a means for performing geographical
analyses using several raster maps.  <EM>r.weight</EM> asks
the user to weight (assign numeric values to) the raster
map categories of interest.  The assignment of weighted
values requires that the user intimately understand the
analysis being undertaken.  How important is the slope of
the land in comparison with the current land use, or the
depth to bedrock?  The assignment of values to the land's
characteristics allows <EM>r.weight</EM> to mix and compare
apples and oranges, such as slopes and land uses, and soil
types and vegetation.

<P>

<EM>r.weight</EM> is a language-driven analysis tool.  It
responds to worded commands typed at the terminal.  Help is
always available via the one word command:  <B>help</B>.
Commands available in <EM>r.weight</EM> are listed below.

<P>

Note that raster map names appear in parentheses.  The use of parentheses
is now optional in <EM>r.weight</EM>.

<H2>SUGGESTED APPROACH</H2>

In order for <EM>r.weight</EM> to generate raster maps
useful for analysis, the user must make a reasonable and
defensible request.  While much more powerful than 
<EM><A HREF="r.combine.html">r.combine</A></EM>,
<EM>r.weight</EM> is also more dangerous.  The user
provides the necessary value judgements which are
registered as weights.  Only well-conceived value
judgements will result in defensible results.  We suggest
the following approach to a weighted overlay analysis:

<DL>
<DT>STEP 1: BEFORE RUNNING WEIGHT

<DD><DL COMPACT>
<DT>a) <DD>Define the question to be answered.  e.g., "Locate 
sites suitable for building apartments."
<DT>b) <DD>Determine what mapped information is useful for 
answering the question.  e.g., geology, soils,
land_use, flood_potential.
<DT>c) <DD>Based on professional judgement, statistical 
inference, and engineering principals, assign 
weights to the categories in the chosen raster maps.
</DL>

<DT>STEP 2: CHOOSE CELL MAPS<P>

<DD>In <EM>r.weight</EM>, use the command <EM>choose</EM>
to identify up to six raster maps of interest.<P>

<DT>STEP 3: ASSIGN WEIGHTS<P>

<DD>Using the <EM>r.weight</EM> command <EM>assign</EM>,
assign specific weights to raster map categories.<P>

<DT>STEP 4: SAVE ANALYSIS<P>

<DD>Use the <EM>save</EM> command to save a copy of the
analysis requested for later use.<P>

<DT>STEP 5: RUN ANALYSIS<P>
<DD>Use <EM>execute</EM> to run the analysis.<P>

<DT>STEP 6: EVALUATE RESULTS<P>

<DD>To modify an existing analysis request, use the
<EM>recover</EM> command to retrieve the analysis and then
go to STEP 3.
