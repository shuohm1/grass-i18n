<H2>NAME</H2>

<EM><b>d.labels</b></EM>  - To 
create/edit GRASS paint label files for display on the graphics
monitor.

<BR>

<EM>(GRASS Display Program)</EM>

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>d.labels</B>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The <EM>d.labels</EM>
program allows the user to interactively create and modify 
paint-labels files for use with the 

<EM><A HREF="p.map.html">p.map</A></EM> and
<EM><A HREF="d.paint.labels.html">d.paint.labels</A></EM> 

programs.  The <EM>paint labels</EM> files created will be
stored in the user's current mapset under the
<KBD>/paint/labels</KBD> directory.

<P>

<EM>d.labels</EM> is fully interactive, and requires use of a graphics monitor.
After the user has typed

<DL>
<DD><B>d.labels</B>
</DL>

and has typed in the name of a new or existing paint-labels
file, the user is asked to indicate label positions on the
display frame using the mouse-pointer, and to edit label
parameters that define the label's size, color, and other
characteristics through use of a visual-ask (VASK) data
entry screen.  The mouse can also be used to indicate the
geographic coordinates of locations within the current
geographic region in the active frame.  It is helpful to
display a relevant data file in the active display frame
before running <EM>d.labels</EM> to provide visual clues
for label placement.

<H2>USER PROMPTS</H2>

You will first be prompted to enter the name of either an
old paint-labels file that you wish to modify, or a new
paint-labels file that you wish to create.  The following
is the file name prompt:

<DL>
<DT>OPTION: Label text file name<P>
key: name<BR>
required: YES<BR>
enter option &gt; <BR>

<DD> If you enter the name of a new (non-existent)
paint-labels file, you are asked to indicate a location
falling within the current geographic region in the active
display frame at which the label is to be placed.

</DL>

<DL>
<DT>Mouse Buttons<BR>
 Left:    Place Label Here<BR>
 Middle:  Where Am I ?<BR>
 Right:   Quit<BR>

<DD> Once you have indicated a position, you will be
presented with a data-entry screen (also known as a VASK
screen) so that you can enter the paint-label parameters
that define how the label will appear on the display or on
the color printer.  Once you finish entering the
label-parameters, and you hit the &lt;ESC&gt; key to
proceed, the label will be displayed on the screen.  If you
like the appearance of the label, enter "y" to the "Look
OK?" prompt;  if not, enter "n" and you will again be
presented with the data entry screen.  Once you approve the
label's appearance you will be asked to indicate the
position of the next label.

</DL>

If you choose to display an already-existing paint-labels
file, you will be shown the labels.  You will then have the
option of editing a label or adding more labels.

<DL>
<DT>Buttons<BR>
 Left:    Edit Existing Labels<BR>
 Middle:  Quit<BR>
 Right:   Add more Labels<BR>
</DL>

On-line help is available.  If you are puzzled about what
should go in a data entry field, just enter "help" in that
field, hit the &lt;ESC&gt; key, and you will be presented
with a short description of the field and what you may
enter.


<P>

The following is a list of the different fields in the data
entry screen and a short description of each.


<DL>

<DT><B>TEXT</B>:

<DD>The user can enter up to four lines of text.

<DT><B>SKIP</B>: <EM>yes/no.</EM>

<DD>If <EM>no</EM>, label will be printed.  If
<EM>yes</EM>, the label will be retained in the file but
not printed.

<DT><B>LOCATION</B>:

<DD>Determines where the text will be located.  The user
specifies the easting and northing in map units, and
(optionally) specifies a vertical and horizontal offset (in
printer pixels) from the specified easting/northing.  (The
vertical (y) offset will shift the location to the south if
positive, north if negative.  The horizontal (x) offset
will shift the location east if positive, west if
negative.)  These offsets are provided to allow finer
placement of labels.


<DT><B>RESET LOCATION</B>: <EM>yes/no.</EM>  

<DD>If <EM>yes</EM>, the user will be allowed to use the
mouse to select a new location for the label.  The mouse
buttons will function as follows:


<P>

Mouse Buttons
 Left:    Place Label Here
 Middle:  Where Am I ?
 Right:   Quit


<P>

<DT><B>PLACEMENT</B>:

<DD>Determines which part of the label to which the
location refers.  This may be specified as:

<P>

	lower left	(lower left corner of the text)
	lower right	(lower right corner of the text)
	lower center	(bottom center of the text)

<P>

	upper left	(upper left corner of the text)
	upper right	(upper right corner of the text)
	upper center	(top center of the text)

<P>
	center	(center of the text)


<P>

<DT><B>TEXT SIZE</B>:

<DD>Determines the size of the lettering used in the
label.  Text size (height) is stated in units of (ground)
meters; e.g., a text size of 500 sets the height of each
line of text equal to 500 ground meters.  Thus, text will
appear to grow or shrink when displayed, depending on the
user's current geographic region settings.

<DT><A NAME="textcolor"><B>TEXT COLOR</B></A>:

<DD>This selects the text color.  This color can be
specified in one of three ways:


<OL>
<LI>By color name:

<BR>

aqua
black
blue
brown
cyan
gray
green
grey
indigo
magenta
orange
purple
red
violet
white
yellow


<LI>As red, green, blue percentages.
For example: .5 .4 .7

<BR>

(This form is not supported by 
<EM><A HREF="d.paint.labels.html">d.paint.labels</A></EM>, 
but see
<EM><A HREF="p.map.html">p.map</A></EM> and 
<EM><A HREF="p.labels.html">p.labels</A></EM>.)


<LI>By printer color number, to get the exact printer color.

<BR>

(This form is not supported by 

<EM><A HREF="d.paint.labels.html">d.paint.labels</A></EM>, 

but see <EM><A HREF="p.map.html">p.map</A></EM> and 

<EM><A HREF="p.labels.html">p.labels</A></EM>.)

</OL>

Note.  If the user sets the text color equal to the
background color, the text will not appear on the graphics
monitor.

<DT><B>WIDTH</B>:

<DD>This determines the line thickness of the letters.  The
normal text width should be set to 1.  Larger numbers can
be used to simulate bold face.

(<EM><A HREF="d.paint.labels.html">d.paint.labels</A></EM> 

ignores this value and always uses 1.)


<DT><B>HIGHLIGHT COLOR</B>:

<DD>The text can be highlighted in another color so that it
appears to be in two colors.  The text is drawn first in
this color at a wider line width, and then redrawn in the
text color at the regular line width.  Highlight colors are
not shown on the graphics display, they are only shown in
the output from

<EM><A HREF="p.labels.html">p.labels</A></EM> and 
<EM><A HREF="p.map.html">p.map</A></EM>.


<P>

<DT><B>HIGHLIGHT WIDTH</B>:

<DD>Specifies how far from the text lines (in pixels) the
highlight color should extend.  Highlight colors are not
shown on the graphics display, they are only shown in the
output from

<EM><A HREF="p.labels.html">p.labels</A></EM> and 
<EM><A HREF="p.map.html">p.map</A></EM>.

<DT><B>BACKGROUND COLOR</B>:

<DD>Text may be boxed in a solid color by specifying a background color
(see <A HREF="#textcolor">TEXT COLOR</A> above to specify a color).
Specify <EM>none</EM> to use no background.


<DT><B>OPAQUE TO VECTORS</B>: <EM>yes/no</EM>.  

<DD>This field only has meaning if a background color is
selected.  <EM>yes</EM> will prevent vector lines from
entering the background.  <EM>no</EM> will allow vector
lines to enter the background.

<DT><B>BORDER COLOR</B>:

<DD>Select a color for the border around the background.
Specify <EM>none</EM> to suppress the border.

<P>

</DL>

<H2>NOTES</H2>

This program is fully interactive and requires no command
line arguments.

<P>

If the user types the word <B>help</B> in a data entry
field while entering label information, acceptable field
choices will be listed.

<P>

Labels must be placed within the current geographic
region.  If the user attempts to place a label outside of
this region, the program will appear to loop endlessly.  It
is simply failing to display a label positioned beyond the
boundaries of the current region; in this event, the user
should simply reposition the label.


<P>

Labels created by this program are stored in ASCII files under
the directory <KBD>$LOCATION/paint/labels</KBD>.
