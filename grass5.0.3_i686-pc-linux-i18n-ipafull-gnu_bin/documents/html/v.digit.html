<H2>NAME</H2>

<EM><b>v.digit</b></EM>  - A menu-driven, highly interactive map
development program used for vector digitizing, editing,
labeling and converting vector data to raster format.

<BR>

<EM>(GRASS Vector Program)</EM>

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>v.digit</B>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The GRASS program <EM>v.digit</EM> is a menu-driven, highly
interactive map development program used for inputting
analog map data into a GRASS vector format.
<EM>v.digit</EM> contains programs for vector digitizing,
editing, labeling, windowing, and converting vector data to
GRASS raster format.

<P>

<EM>v.digit</EM>
consists of two parts: an initialization procedure, 
and a multiple menu-driven environment. 

<OL>

<LI>The initialization procedure involves choosing a digitizer, 
choosing the name of a vector map layer to digitize, and, 
if needed, registering a map to the digitizing surface. It is important
to specify the map scale.

<LI>The second part of <EM>v.digit</EM> is a multiple-menu
environment in which digitizing, editing, labeling, and
other options are available. It is within this second
portion of <EM>v.digit</EM> that all vector creation
occurs.

</OL>

<H2>NOTES</H2>

<EM>v.digit</EM> was written to optimize digitizing speed
and performance.  It has a convenient graphic display
format and very convenient windowing capabilities. Features
are color-coded for ease of identification and
verification.  Different color schemes may be user-chosen
to customize a digitizing session.

<P>

Area, line, and point features may be digitized in both
"stream" and "point" modes. Both a mouse and a digitizer
may be used to perform windowing functions.  Labeling and
editing are done from within <EM>v.digit</EM>, rather than
through a separate set of programs.

<P>

<EM>v.digit</EM> has capabilities that allow users to display raster maps in
background (Customize menu, Backdrop), to overlay already existing vector
map layers onto the feature being digitized (Customize menu, Overlay), and
set a multitude of parameters to furtherly customize a digitizing session.

<P>

<EM>v.digit</EM> may be used with or without a digitizer.
Many options are available if no digitizer is used, i.e. digitizer
support by mouse.

<P>

All options available within <EM>v.digit</EM> are contained
within ten menus.  Movement from menu to menu is done by
chosing the movement options specified at the bottom of
each menu.

<P>
<b>Digitizer support</b> <p> 

GRASS is using device independent code written originally by John Dabritz
formerly of the Forest Service, which uses ascii description files to define
how to communicate with the digitizer. The result is that we should be able
to support just about any digitizer out there now with a minimum of work.
Refer to the "digitizer definition manual" for information on the format of
these files.
