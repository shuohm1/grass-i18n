<H2>NAME</H2>

<EM><b>r.nntool</b></EM> - Neural Network classification tool for raster maps.
<BR>

<EM>(GRASS Raster Program)</EM>

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>r.nntool</B>

<BR>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2> r.nntool is a fully interactive, menu-driven
GRASS routine that uses a neural network to train landuse
classifications and build a classified image. r.nntool facilitates the
use of neural networks and linear classifiers in supervised
classification of raster cell files. <br>
Neural networks are composed of
simple non-linear computational units called neurons that are linked
together and work cooperatively to solve complex mapping
problems. Neural network output is validated by the use of a
controlled training dataset. For application in the GRASS framework,
each input unit (equal to one satellite image pixel) to the neural
network is assigned a raster map layer, and training data for the
network is collected on a cell by cell basis. Typically, a single map
layer is used for selecting training sites, although this requirement
can be relaxed so that output units can be assigned to more than one
map layer, and the map layer used in selecting training sites need not
be used as output to the neural network. Since a maximum likelihood
classifier (i.maxlik) already exists in GRASS, many of the utilities
of i.maxlik in selecting and analyzing training data were used in the
neural network tool. Among these utilities is the ability to visualize
and, if necessary, change histograms from each training site.
<p>
 The program for the neural network tool is structured in such as a way
that training classes selected in the neural network tool could also
be used in the maximum likelihood classifier. This facilitates the
implementation of i.maxlik within GRASS for validation of neural
network outut. <br>
In GRASS, the maximum likelihood classifier assumes a
Gaussian distribution for the training data, which is a widely used
method for satellie imagery classification. In the use of the tool,
the user is asked to enter the name of the output map layer, the
number of output classes, and the names of the input map layers. 
<br>
Using the lump option of the menu, the tool selects the "dominant" category
within a specified window and generates a new map layer. The user can
reset the resolution to the specified window, or retain the old
resolution in which he entered the tool. In existing GRASS routines,
when resolution (window) of a region is enlarged, the middle pixel of
the window in the lower resolution is selected.  <br>
Training areas are selected using the define areas option. <br>
Using the zoom option the user can zoom out parts of the output map 
in which he wishes to delineate training areas. Training areas can be 
delineated by clicking on points, drawing circles, or by drawing 
polygons. <br>
Using the delete function, the users can interactively select 
and delete polygons, with the number of samples after deletion shown in the window. <br>
Histograms of training sites can be examined and signatures saved so that the
user can use i.maxlik. Once the user is satisfied with the training
sites selected, all input map layers are sampled for their data. At
intersections of training areas with input map layers, training data
for the neural network are gathered. <br>
Training data are stored as an
ASCII file so that the user may examine and change it, if
necessary. Input data to the network is obtained cell-wise from all
areas of the input maps. <br>
The classes option of the neural network tool
lets a user examine the distribution of data when two input map layers
are used. For higher input dimensions, it is necessary to link the
tool to a more sophisticated program such as xgobi. The user may
eliminate outliers, and data conflicts by drawing rectangular boxes
around data points. If necessary a whitening and diagonalization
operation can be done on the data so that better class separability is
achieved. Unlike in using traditional classifiers, careful
preprocessing of the training data should be performed since neural
networks give equal consideration to all data. <br>
Once the user is
satisfied with the class distributions, the configure option is
selected. Here the user selects a quick propagation network, or the
traditional back propagation The quick propagation network uses
gradient descent to adjust weights and assumes a parabolic shape for
global minimum. Iterations of the network are performed by the number
of training cycles set by the user. Back propagation uses gradient
descent and converges to a root mean square error value set by the
user. <br>
In r.nntool, performance of the network as training progresses
is shown on the left half of the GRASS screen. Once training of the
neural network is complete, the user propagates cell values of the
input map layers through the network. The new map layer generated by
the neural network can then be queried. Upon completion of network
training, the user may save the neural network structure such as the
number of input, hidden, and output units, and the network weights.
 
<H2>Notes</H2>
The training site I/O data is stored in a file called o_train 
(o_ for "old" training file). This is the default file used for training 
the neural network. If the random option is used to rearrange the 
training data, the network training data is stored in a file called 
TRAIN. The classes option can only be used right now for visualization 
of two input vectors. The color scheme isn't all that exciting and 
future upgrades are working on using a better color scheme to represent 
the training data in each class. [Users may wish to also ftp xgobi.tar.gz, 
and use that tool to visualize training samples in the o_train/TRAIN file]. 
The Bayes' classifier right now can only be used if you have access to 
IMSL (otherwise, you'll have to wait until routines are written for diagonalizing a covariant matrix etc in C). Users will have to do a 
priori determine the attribute value for each class in the output map:
<p>
 Ex., Say there are 5 classes. Extend the attribute values for the classes 
from 0 to 100. So that, 
<p>
<pre>
       0 - class 1 
      25 - class 2 
      50 - class 3 
      75 - class 4 
     100 - class 5. 
</pre>

This is a limitation of GRASS since the color intensities of a map are determined by the attribute values. The input values to the network are 
scaled by the highest attribute of each input. Users may wish to try other 
schemese such as sgn(x)(1 + ln|x|), or transform the data using a squashing 
function such as tahn(x). Users will have to look at the source code to 
do this (see nntool.c).
