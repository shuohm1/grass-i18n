<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>v.in.sdts</EM> creates one or more GRASS vector maps in the current mapset 
from a Spatial Data Transfer Standard dataset conforming to the Topological 
Vector Profile (TVP).  The program generates GRASS <EM>dig</EM>, <EM>dig_att</EM>, 
and <EM>dig_cats</EM> files.  Also, if requested, files of attributes in database-ready form 
are created, along with scripts to create an approprate SQL-compliant 
relational database, 
and load the attribute files into the new database.  Special database-ready 
files of tables linking the attributes to the GRASS vector map layer or 
layers are also generated.


<P>

The source SDTS dataset must be in the user's current directory.  The files
that make up the dataset are listed in the dataset's Catalog/Directory file
(CATD); this file is specified by the user with the <B>catd</B> parameter.
<P>
<EM>v.in.sdts</EM> creates maps in your current mapset, and will only import map data if there is correspondence between the current mapset's coordinate system
and that of the transfer set; in addition, for UTM (and State Plane), Zone
designations must match.  These specifications can be displayed be running
<EM>v.in.sdts</EM> in "Information only" mode.  "Information only" mode is 
automatically
put in effect when there is a mis-match between source and target coordinate 
systems.
<P>
An SDTS dataset may consist of one or several distinct map layers (or
"2-D manifolds", in SDTS terminology), coinciding with one or more
partitions of the earth's surface.  If a dataset contains more than one
map layer, the grouping of object data into individual map layers, and of 
groups of map layers, is specified in the Catalog/Spatial Domain (CATS) file,
in terms of "domain", "map", "theme", and/or "manifold" ("aggregate object").  
If available, this information is displayed to the user in "Information 
Only" mode.  The user can then either 
<DT>
<DD>(1) import all the map layers in a 
transfer at once, or 
<DD>(2) select a subset of the transfer consisting of one 
or more maps by specifying a domain name, map name, etc.  
</DT>
<P>
<H2>COMMAND LINE OPTIONS</H2>
<P>
<H3>Flags:</H3>
<DL>
<DT><B>-i</B> 

<DD>"Information-only" mode.  Information about the dataset and any individual 
map layers in the dataset are displayed. No map layers or attribute files 
are generated. Information displayed includes basic identifying data 
(TITLE of transfer dataset, map date, dataset creation date, scale, 
coordinate system, etc.).  For individual maps, any names found in the 
CATS file specifying map, theme, domain, manifold, are given. Bounding 
coordinates for each map layer are also printed.

<BR>

The program will also run in "information only" mode if (1) no output name 
is specified,  or (2) the coordinate system, or, in the case of UTM and State 
Plane, Zone, of the dataset to be imported does not match the current mapset. 

<DT><B>-l</B> 

<DD>Import object link table(s) only; do not create attribute tables.  If this flag is set, and if <B>dbpath</B> is set, only the vector map 
(<EM>dig</EM>, <EM>dig_att</EM>, and <EM>dig_cats</EM>) and the file containing the 
database-ready 
table linking the vector map with the attribute tables will be created; 
the attribute files themselves will not be created.  This option is useful 
if the user wants to selectively import data layers from an SDTS dataset 
with multiple maps.  One map could be imported with its object link table and 
the full set of attributes; subsequent layers imported with the "<B>-l</B>" 
option would avoid recopying the full set of attributes. 
</DL>


<P>


<H3>Parameters:</H3>


<DL>


<DT><B>catd=</B><EM>name</EM> 

<DD>Full name of SDTS file containing the Catalog/Directory (CATD) module 
for the source dataset. The file name format is specified by SDTS and the
TVP as <EM>xxxxCATD.DDF</EM>, where <EM>xxxx</EM> are 4 digits or upper-case letters 
or any combination therof. The CATD file must be located along with the 
rest of the SDTS dataset in the current directory.  The CATD file 
contains a listing of all the dataset files, and is thus the necessary
starting point for the transfer process.  

<BR>

Note that the same four-character prefix of the CATD file is used
for all files in the SDTS dataset. This prefix is also used by 
<EM>v.in.sdts</EM> for the naming of the output attribute files (see 
<EM>The GRASS-SDTS User Guide</EM> for details.)


<P>


<DT><B>output=</B><EM>name</EM> 

<DD>name for output vector map layer.  If the SDTS dataset contains 
multiple maps, and if no particular one is specified, causing 
all the maps to be imported, maps will be distinguished by name 
plus numeric suffix. If not specified the module runs
in "information mode" (-i flag) and no output is written.


<P>


<DT><B>dbpath=</B><EM>name</EM> 

<DD>full path to location for placement of database-ready attribute files 
preparatory to their installation in a relational database.  Path 
must exist and be writable by the user. Setting the <B>dbath</B> parameter
causes database-ready files to be created; otherwise they are not created.


<P>


<DT><B>domain=</B><EM>name</EM> 

<DD>
<DT><B>map=</B><EM>name</EM> 

<DD>
<DT><B>theme=</B><EM>name</EM> 

<DD>
<DT><B>manifold=</B><EM>name</EM> 

<DD>if one or more domain, map, theme, or manifold ("aggregate object") 
names are given in the SDTS dataset Catalog/Spatial Domain (CATS) 
file, map layers so designated can be selected with the appropriate
parameter. "Information only" mode lists any such names found in 
the CATS file.
</DL>
<P>
<H2>SPATIAL OBJECTS IN SDTS AND GRASS</H2>
<P>
SDTS and the Topological Vector Profile define two basic types of spatial 
objects: simple spatial objects, i.e., lines,  polygons, nodes, etc.; and 
composite objects, which are made up of one or more other simple and/or 
composite spatial objects.  SDTS composite objects, which GRASS cannot 
handle directly, are imported as records in RDBMS-ready tables.  Details on 
the mapping of simple and composite spatial objects between SDTS and GRASS 
may be found in the <EM>GRASS-SDTS User Guide</EM>.
<P>
<H2>SDTS ATTRIBUTE IMPORT</H2>
<P>
Only a brief explanation of SDTS attributes and v.in.sdts's handling of
them is given here.  See the <EM>GRASS/SDTS User Guide</EM> for details.
<P>
SDTS is capable of substantial attribute complexity.  SDTS distinguishes
between two basic kinds of attributes: primary attributes are related
directly to spatial objects (simple or composite), while secondary 
attributes are related to primary or to other secondary attributes.  
In SDTS, attributes are stored in relational tables, and spatial objects
may be linked to multiple attributes in one or more different 
attribute tables.  The schema of an SDTS dataset--the number and kind of
attribute fields and attribute tables, and the relationships among attributes 
and objects--is not predefined by the Standard or the Profile, but is
determined by the producer of the dataset.
<P>
For most kinds of data likely to be available through SDTS, optimal access
requires use of GRASS with a relational database management system.  In
support of this, <EM>v.in.sdts</EM> imports SDTS attribute tables in a form ready 
for use with your RDBMS.  It also produces SQL-compatible scripts to set up 
the relational database and install the data.
<P>

<EM>dig_att and dig_cats files:</EM> The program does generate <EM>dig_att</EM> and 
<EM>dig_cats</EM> files, and for relatively
simple SDTS datasets, i.e., those with one-to-one object-attribute 
relationships with all object attributes in a single attribute table,
an associated relational database is not necessary.  In addition, for more
complex datasets, the <EM>dig_att</EM> and <EM>dig_cats</EM> files are constructed in such a
way as to facilitate post-import incorporation of selected data from the
attribute files for use without recourse to a relational database.
Specifically, the contents of the generated <EM>dig_att</EM> and <EM>dig_cats</EM> 
files are as follows:
<P>
<DT><EM>dig_att</EM> 

<DD>Contains an entry for each attributed non-composite object (line, 
polygon, point). each entry will be assigned a unique category integer 
value.  These integers, or feature-IDs (FID), also uniquely identify 
the same spatial objects, in the relational database object link table.
<EM>dig_cats</EM> 
For datasets with one-to-one object-attribute relationships and a single 
object-related attribute module, only one database-ready "object-attribute"
file is created, and the <EM>dig_cats</EM> records are given the same content, 
as the generated database-ready file. Record structure is as follows:
<PRE>
FID | obj_code | attr_code | attr. field 1 |...| attr. field n |
</PRE>
(<EM>obj_code</EM> and <EM>attr_code</EM> are codes, derived from record IDs in the
SDTS dataset, which function as keys in the import relational database. See
<EM>The GRASS-SDTS User Guide</EM> for details.)
<P>
For other datasets, the <EM>dig_cats</EM> file is identical in content
to the generated GRASS-database object link table, and records would have the
structure:
<PRE>
FID | obj_code     or    FID | obj_code | attr_code
</PRE>
</DT>

<P>
Full discussion of this topic may be found in the <EM>GRASS-SDTS User Guide</EM>.
<H2>FILE NAMES</H2>
<P>
<EM>vector map name:</EM> if the SDTS dataset contains a single map layer, or if a
a single map layer from a multiple-map dataset, the name specified in
output is used as is. Otherwise, the name is extended with integers to
specify the individual layers.
<EM>relational database file names:</EM> see the GRASS-SDTS User Guide.
