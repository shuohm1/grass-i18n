<H2>NAME</H2>

<B><i>r.answers </i></B> - Menu-driven interface from GRASS to ANSWERS

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>r.answers</B>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>r.answers</B> integrates ANSWERS (1991) with GRASS.  ANSWERS
(Areal Nonpoint Source Watershed Environmental Response
Simulation) is an event oriented, distributed parameter
model that was developed to simulate the behavior of
watersheds having agriculture as their primary land use.
Its primary applications are watershed planning for erosion
and sediment control on complex watersheds, and water
quality analysis associated with sediment associated
chemicals.

<P>

<B>r.answers</B> provides a menu of steps to complete the
input required to run an ANSWERS simulation. Each
simulation is treated as "project" by <B>r.answers</B>. The
inputs collected for the steps completed are recorded under
a project name, so that they may be copied or recalled for
further completion or modification. The first menu one
encounters when running <B>r.answers</B> includes functions
to create a new project, work on existing projects, copy an
existing project, and remove existing projects. The main
menu (shown below) lists steps to be completed to prepare
ANSWERS input, to run ANSWERS, plus other miscellaneous
functions.

Steps 1-11 record and display their status to the left of the 
step number. If a step has not been run, no status is displayed
(as seen above). If the step has been successfully completed, the
status will be listed as "done". In some cases, a change in one
step will cause the need to run another step again, in which case
the status will read "rerun". If a step has a status of "done"
or "rerun", if it is run again it will attempt to offer previous
inputs as defaults.


<P>

</H2><B>Interface Operation Notes</B></H2>

Throughout <B>r.answers</B> two primary types of interface/input are used:

<P>
<DT>

<DD>1) Text input that can be completed by hitting the RETURN key.
In most cases, if no text was entered, the given question
or operation is canceled. Often times text input will consist
of the name of a new or existing map or project name, in which 
case entering the word "list" will provide a list of currently
used names.
<P>
<DD>2) Text or menu options that can be completed by hitting the ESC
(escape) key. This type of interface is used for menus or
for entering tables of parameters. All menus have a default
answer of Exit (0), so that by simply hitting ESC one may
leave the program's menus. The following keystroke guide 
is helpful to know when using the parameter entry worksheets
that use this interface:
</DT>
<PRE>
&lt;RETURN&gt; moves the cursor to next prompt field
&lt;CTRL-K&gt; moves the cursor to previous prompt field
&lt;CTRL-H&gt; moves the cursor backward non-destructively within the field
&lt;CTRL-L&gt; moves the cursor forward non-destructively within the field
&lt;CTRL-A&gt; writes a copy of the screen to a file named "visual_ask" in your home directory
&lt;CTRL-C&gt; where indicated (on bottom line of screen) can be used to cancel operation
</PRE>

<H2>Description of Main Menu Steps</H2>

The following section describes each option of the main menu.
All steps are verbose to provide as much immediate information
as is practical, however
it is necessary that the user also be familiar with the operation
of ANSWERS. (Obtain a copy of the <EM>ANSWERS User's Manual</EM>
(1991)
by David Beasley and Larry Huggins. Available from Bernard
Engel, Agricultural Engineering, Purdue University,
W. Lafayette, Indiana, 47907).


<P>

Steps 1 through 10 collect inputs (either maps from the currently
available mapsets or other text/numerical inputs) in order to
create or extract the necessary portions of ANSWERS inputs for that
step. After steps 1 through 10 are done, step 11 can be run
to assemble an ANSWERS input file. ANSWERS can then be run using
the inputs, and the output from the simulation is captured
and processed, as described under step 11.
<P>
<DT>
<B>Step 1 Set mask, region, and resolution</B>
<P>
<DD><EM>Map input:</EM> Watershed mask
<BR>
<EM>Other inputs:</EM> Project resolution, project region (optional)
<BR>
<EM>Description:</EM> All raster values in the input mask map greater 
than zero will be used to create reclass rules to set the project 
MASK to the watershed area. Each time the project is called, the 
MASK will be automatically set. Project resolution is input in meters
and it used to set the size of the watershed elements to be used in 
the simulation. The part of this step attempts to find the minimal
region needed to contain the watershed mask at the given resolution.
A region will be calculated to allow at least a one-cell border around
the watershed area. This region is then presented in an input screen
(much like that of <B>r.region</B>) for editing or approval. After
the project mask, region and resolution are set, the information is
recorded and will be reset automatically each time the project is called.
This step will create a new raster map in the user's current mapset
enTITLEd <EM>project name</EM>&gt;.ELEMENT. This map will act as a reference to
ANSWERS' methods of refering to raster cells. Raster values of the
map will indicate element number, with the category description giving
row and column numbers.
If any of the inputs in this step are subsequently reset, all other
steps that may have been completed will be marked with a status of
"rerun", since changing mask, resolution or region will require that
inputs will have to be resampled. 
</DT>
<P>
<DT>
<B>Step 2 Catalogue soils parameters</B>
<P>
<DD><EM>Map input:</EM> Soils
<BR>
<EM>Other input:</EM> Soils parameters, tile drainage coefficient, groundwater
release fraction.
<BR>
<EM>Description:</EM> This step prompts for the name of a soil
map, then reads the map and lists all soil categories found in
the watershed mask. For each soil found in the watershed,
ANSWERS requires 
values for the parameters listed below. The Project Manager facilitates
preparation parameters by input into a table.
<P>
<PRE>
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|Soil Parameters for ANSWERS (see ANSWERS Users Manual for more details) |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|1      total porosity (percent pore space volume of soil)               |
|2      field capacity (percent saturation)                              |
|3      steady state infiltration rate (mm/hour)                         |
|4      difference between steady state and maximum infiltration         |
|        rate (mm/hour)                                                  |
|5      exponent in infiltration equation                                |
|6      infiltration control zone depth (mm)                             |
|7      antecedent soil moisture (percent saturation)                    |
|8      USLE 'K'                                                         |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
</PRE>
<P>
After the soil parameters are input, a screen will prompt for
groundwater release fraction and tile drainage coefficient,
which will apply to the entire watershed.
The tile drainage coefficient indicates the design coefficient 
(mm/day) of
tile drains in those areas designated as having tile drainage.
The groundwater release fraction is measure of the contribution
of lateral groundwater movement or interflow to total runoff.
<P>
After this step is completed, it will provide an option to 
save the entered parameters to a file or printer for reference.
ANSWERS soils inputs will then be extracted and stored.
This step may be rerun to change any of the information.
Previously entered information will be recalled and may be modified.
</DT>
<P>
<DT>
<B>Step 3 Catalogue land use and surface parameters</B>
<P>
<DD>
<EM>Map input:</EM> Land cover/use.
<BR>
<EM>Other input:</EM> Land cover parameters
<BR>
<EM>Description:</EM> For each category in the land use map found
in the watershed, ANSWERS requires
values for the parameters listed below. The Project Manager facilitates
preparation parameters by input into a table.
<P>
<PRE>
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|Land Cover Parameters for ANSWERS (see ANSWERS Users Manual for details) |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|1      short (8 characters) description of land use and management       |
|       (program will attempt to use map category description, if any)    |
|2      mm of potential rainfall interception by land cover               |
|3      percentage of surface covered by specified land use               |
|4      oughness coefficient of the surface (a shape factor)              |
|5      m of maximum roughness height of the surface profile              |
|6      Manning's n (a measure of flow retardance of the surface)         |
|7      relative erosiveness (function of time and USLE 'C' and 'P')      |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
</PRE>
<P>
After this step is completed, it will provide an option to 
save the entered parameters to a file or printer for reference.
ANSWERS cover inputs will then be extracted and stored.
This step may be rerun to change any of the information.
Previously entered information will be recalled and may be modified.
</DT>
<P>
<DT>
<B>Step 4 Identify elevation-based input layers</B>
<P>
<DD><EM>Map input:</EM> Slope and aspect.
<BR>
<EM>Description:</EM> This step prompts for the names of previously prepared
maps of slope and aspect for the project watershed. It is important to 
note that the required format of slope and aspect maps vary from that created by
the <B><A HREF="r.slope.aspect.html">r.slope.aspect</A></B> program. Programs have been developed to 
process an elevation surface map and create ANSWERS slope and aspect
map. The elevation map should be true elevations in meters. The elevation
map can be "filtered" to remove "pits" and other potential problems
to ANSWERS with the <B><A HREF="r.fill.dir.html">r.fill.dir</A></B> program.
The <B><A HREF="r.direct.html">r.direct</A></B> program can be used to prepare an ANSWERS aspect
map from the elevation layer created by <B><A HREF="r.fill.dir.html">r.fill.dir</A></B>.
The <B>r.slope.aspect</B> program can be used to prepare an ANSWERS slope
map from the elevation layer created by <B><A HREF="r.fill.dir.html">r.fill.dir</A></B>.
ANSWERS requires slope values which are percent multiplied by 10
(so a slope map value of 35 indicated a slope of 3.5%).
The aspect map is a critical input to ANSWERS, since it defines the
routing of runoff through the watershed, and should be carefully
examined, since the <B><A HREF="r.direct.html">r.direct</A></B> program is unable to create 
flawless output. The <B><A HREF="d.rast.arrow.html">d.rast.arrow</A></B> and the <B><A HREF="d.rast.edit.html">d.rast.edit</A></B> programs
have been developed to assist this manual inspection and editing process.
When editing the flow direction map, pay careful attention to 1) cells on the watershed border, which all
must flow into the watershed. 2) cells that will be declared as "channels"
must flow directly from one to another (therefore it is suggested
that channels should be identified in conjunction with
this step). 3) flow from two cells must not point directly to each other
(-&gt;&lt;-) or otherwise form circuitous routes. In the final flow map, one 
should be able to start at any cell in
the watershed and follow the flow directions from cell to cell until arriving
at the outlet cell.
</DT>
<P>
<DT>
<B>Step 5 Prepare rain gauge data</B>
<P>
<DD><EM>Map input:</EM> Rain gauge areas (for multiple gauges)
<BR>
<EM>Other input:</EM> Rain gauge data
<BR>
<EM>Description:</EM> This step is designed to organize data used to describe the
precipitation event to be simulated. ANSWERS permits up to four rain
gauges to be used, each of which will require a table of rainfall
data (time in minutes and rainfall intensity in millimeters per hour).
Data from at least one rain gauge are required. If more than one gauge
is used, you will need to prepare a raster map of the watershed
area to indicate which cells are to represented by a given gauge's
data.
<P>
To facilitate the modeling of a number of storms
this step will prompt for a rainfall event name. The data tables entered
will be stored in the ANSWERS database under the event name.
<P>
Rain gauge data for ANSWERS consists two columns of numbers.
The first is Time (in minutes) and the second is Rainfall Intensity
(in mm/hour). Decimal values will be rounded to the closest
whole number.
To input rain gauge data to the Project Manager, a file must first
be prepared with rain gauge data.  If multiple gauges are to be used,
one input file is still used, data for each gauge are separated by
'-1' flag in the "Time" (first) column. Data for multiple gauges
should occur sequentially by gauge; so that data for gauge 1 is first
in the file, data for gauge two is the second group of data, and so
on. 
<P>
Example rain gauge data input files:
<P>
<PRE>
        +----------+------------------------------------------+
        |one gauge |    two gauges                            |
        +----------+------------------------------------------+
        |  0    0  |  0          0                            |
        | 10    3  | 11          1          data for gauge 1  |
        | 20   10  | 25          7                            |
        | 35   22  | -1 &lt;----- delimiter                      |
        | 55    9  |  0          0                            |
        | 67    4  | 15          6          data for gauge 2  |
        |100    0  | 10          4                            |
        +----------+------------------------------------------+
</PRE>
<P>
This step will prompt to determine if multiple rain gauges are to
be used. If so, it will prompt for the name of a map that 
represents areas to be assigned to the given gauges. The number of
categories and their value should match the number of rain gauges.
Next the program prompts for the name of the rain gauge data file.
The program reads the file and displays what it found to the screen
for approval. Having this, it will create the appropriate ANSWERS input
files.
</DT>
<P>
<DT>
<B>Step 6 Identify outlet cell</B>
<P>
<DD><EM>Map input:</EM> none
<BR>
<EM>Other input:</EM> row and column number of watershed outlet element
<BR>
<EM>Description:</EM> ANSWERS needs to know the row and column number 
of the element at
the watershed outlet. To facilitate your finding this information,
The raster map <EM>&lt;project name&gt;</EM>.ELEMENT has been created.
The category values of this map are the sequentially numbered cells
of the watershed. The category descriptions are the cell's row and
column number. Using a tool such as <B>d.what.rast</B>, the row and
column number of the outlet cell can be queried from the displayed
element map.
</DT>
<P>
<DT>
<B>Step 7 Specify areas with subsurface drainage</B>
<P>
<DD><EM>Map input: Areas with subsurface drainage (optional)</EM>
<BR>
<EM>Description:</EM> This step offers a menu which allows the delineation
of 1) all the watershed with subsurface drainage, 2) none of the 
watershed with subsurface drainage, or 3) areas with subsurface drainage
specified with a raster map (all elements with a value greater than
zero will be input to ANSWERS as having subsurface drainage.
Note: the drainage coefficient for areas with subsurface
is set with the other soils parameters in step 2. If "all" or "none"
of the watershed is simulated as having subsurface drainage, no
input map is required; otherwise a raster map is used to specify areas
with subsurface drainage.
</DT>
<P>
<DT>
<B>Step 8 Catalogue channel parameters</B>
<P>
<DD><EM>Map input:</EM> Channels
<BR>
<EM>Other input:</EM> Channel width and roughness coefficient for each 
category of channel
<BR>
<EM>Description:</EM> Watershed cells with a well-defined channel 
should be defined
to ANSWERS. ANSWERS assumes the channel is rectangular in 
cross-section and is sufficiently deep to handle runoff.
<P>
To prepare channel data for use with ANSWERS, the following is
needed: a raster map layer of the channels in the watershed
and a description of width (meters) and roughness (Manning's
"n") for each channel
category found in the layer.
<P>
It is suggested that the aspect map from Step 4 be created in
conjunction with the channel map, since ANSWERS will abort operation
if a one channel element does not flow directly into another
adjacent channel element.
</DT>
<P>
<DT>
<B>Step 9 Define channel slopes</B>
<P>
<DD><EM>Map input:</EM> Channel slope  
<BR>
<EM>Description:</EM> An optional input to ANSWERS is the slope of channels.
If a channel
slope input is not given, ANSWERS assumes the slope for the channel
is the same as the overland slope for the element.
<P>
If desired, a raster map may be used to define channel slope values.
To do so, a raster map should be prepared with category values for
channel slopes in tenths of a percent (i.e. a category value of 31 
would indicate a channel slope of 3.1 percent).
<P>
Note: Even though channel slopes are an optional input to ANSWERS,
this step must be run if only to say no map will be used. 
</DT>
<P>
<DT>
<B>Step 10 Specify BMP's in watershed</B>
<P>
<DD><EM>Map input:</EM> Tile Outlet Terrace, Sedimentation Pond, Grassed Waterway, 
and/or Field Borders.

<BR>

<EM>Other input:</EM> Grassed waterway or field border width (meters)

<BR>

<EM>Description:</EM> This step provides a menu to prepare any or none
of the four structural Best Management Practices (BMPs) that ANSWERS
recognizes. 
Many BMPs can be described to ANSWERS by changing variables describing
the surface condition of the soil. Practices which are tillage-oriented,
for example, are described in the soils and land use sections. Gully
structures such as a drop spillway may be simulated by reducing channel
slope. On the other hand, BMPs which are structural in nature require
a change in land use (row crop to grass for waterways, for example).
ANSWERS recognizes four optional BMP structures. Even though
the use of BMP structures is optional, this step still must be run
to verify this.
NOTE: Since ANSWERS will recognize one BMP for a given
watershed element, the most effective BMP should be used.
The following is a brief discussion of the BMPs:
<P>
1. ANSWERS Tile Outlet Terrace Assumptions:
<P>
 - Trap efficiency of 90%
<BR>
 - Only lowermost terraces are described
<P>
Also, if a terrace exists only in a portion of an element,
the assumption is made that all incoming flow is influenced by
the BMP. Thus, elements which have only a small portion of the
practice within their boundaries should not be given credit for
the practice. 
<P>
2. ANSWERS Sedimentation Pond Assumptions: 
<P>
 - Trap efficeincy of 95%
<BR>
 - Only ponds in upland areas should be defined. In stream
   structures are treated differently.
<P>
Also, if a pond exists only in a portion of an element,
the assumption is made that all incoming flow is influenced by
the BMP. Thus, elements which have only a small portion of the
practice within their boundaries should not be given credit for
the practice. 
<P>
3. ANSWERS Grassed Waterway Assumptions:
<P>
 - The vegetated area with in the affected element is no longer
subject to any sediment detachment.
<BR>
 - The model deliberately prohibits deposition within
the vegetation of a grass waterway, since any waterway
that effectively traps sediment would soon fill and
become ineffective.
<P>
For each category found in the layer, you will be prompted
for width of the waterway
<P>
4. ANSWERS Field Border Assumptions
<P>
 - The vegetated area with in the affected element is no longer
subject to any sediment detachment.
<P>
For each category found in the layer, you will be prompted
for width of the field border.
</DT>
<P>
<DT>
<B>Step 11 Prepare ANSWERS input and run simulation</B>
<P>
<DD><EM>Description:</EM> Steps 1-10 must have a status of "done" before
this step can be run. (Even steps for optional inputs must be run
before an ANSWERS input file can be completed.) Each of the prior
steps will have prepared their part of the ANSWERS input. The first
function of this step is to compile all the parts together.
Once the input file is complete, the simulation can be run.
(NOTE: r.answers will call the ANSWERS program, which must be compiled
as a part of the r.answers installation. The source code for ANSWERS
should be part of the software distributed with r.answers.)
The error messages that ANSWERS may send to "standard output" are
captured to a file by r.answers and displayed.
If none, a message to that effect
will be printed to the screen (although this doesn't mean that the 
simulation ran entirely error-free). The primary output of the 
simulation is captured to another file, then processed to separate
it into component parts of 
<P>
<DT>
<DD>1) <EM>text</EM> - the verbose reiteration
of the inputs and summary of watershed characteristics. This is useful
for checking to insure that inputs were read in by ANSWERS properly;
<DD>2) <EM>outlet hydrograph data</EM> of rainfall, runoff and sediment yield and 
concentration. If these data are in order, they will be processed
into a format readable by the <B>d.linegraph</B> program for display;
<DD>3) <EM>individual element net sedimentation</EM> showing sediment loss
or deposition, if any, for each raster element in the watershed.
</DT>
<P>
Also, <EM>sediment deposition in channel elements</EM>.
This step will prompt for names to use for new watershed maps it will
create by extracting these data from the output. If the simulation
event did not create sediment loss or deposition, or channel
deposition for the scenario,
the given map will not be created.
To find out how to access the output files, see the description of
step 12, below.

<P>
<DT>
<B>Step 12 Miscellaneous Command Menu</B>
<P>
<DD>This step calls a menu that 
<P>
<DT>
<DD>1) allows access to the project files in the
project database and to 
<DD>2) a function that prepares a summary of
the project's current status.
</DT>
<P>
The project database is where <B>r.answers</B> stores all the inputs,
output, and other non-map data associated with the project. See the 
"FILES" section (below) for more information. There are two sections
to the project data, since rainfall data are kept in a separate
directory. When using this step to access database files, the 
program will list both the project data and the rain data files, and
ask which section you wish to access. Next you will be prompted for
the name of the file to access. This request will be turned over to
the "file handler program" which facilitates sending a file to the
screen, copying to another file, or printing.
<P>
The project status function available under step 12 creates a 
helpful summary
of the project, and then passes control to the "file handler program"
for display, copying to a file, or printing.

<H2>FILES</H2>
Index of ANSWERS on GRASS database files
<P>
Each project will create and use the following files
in $LOCATION/answers/&lt;<EM>project name</EM>&gt;/data.
For the most part, there isn't much to see, unless
something is not working right. If that is the case,
The first thing to check would be files listed here under the
Output section or Input file. Furthermore, attempting
to fix a problem by editing any of these files could
prove to have unpredictable results. Once a problem is
identified (with the input maps or parameters, most
likely) fix the input maps if need be, run r.answers
again to make any changes, such a using a different
map or correcting parameters. Remember that if a map is
changed the menu step that uses it must be run again
to resample the inputs. Run step 11 again to create a
new input file and re-run ANSWERS.
