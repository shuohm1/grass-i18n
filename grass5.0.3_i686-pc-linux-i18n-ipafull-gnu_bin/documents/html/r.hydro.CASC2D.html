<H2>DISCLAIMER</H2> 
<P>
Users with no background in or understanding of distributed hydrology
are strongly advised against using this code in any mode, particularly
in operational mode. Besides knowledge of basic hydrology, experience
with typical numerical techniques used in physically-based hydrodynamic
models is recommended as it will help the user grasp capabilities
and limitations of this model. This manual is significantly condensed
for electronic distribution and is in no way comprehensive. Users
are encouraged to experiment with the model and venture in hydrology
textbooks and journal papers to learn more about the topics touched
upon in this manual. The <I>r.hydro.CASC2D </I>code is continuously
being improved. Changes in the source code of <I>r.hydro.CASC2D
</I>may be made at any time, without notification. No claims are
made regarding the suitability of <I>r.hydro.CASC2D </I>for any
particular purpose. The model <I>r.hydro.CASC2D </I>was written
for research and educational purposes.
<P>
<H2>HISTORY</H2> 
<P>
CASC2D originally began with the two-dimensional overland flow
routing algorithm developed in APL by Prof. P.Y. Julien at Colorado
State University. The overland flow routing module was converted
from APL to FORTRAN by Bahram Saghafian, then at Colorado State
University, with the addition of Green &amp; Ampt infiltration
and explicit channel routing (Julien and Saghafian, 1991, Saghafian,
1992, and Julien et al., 1995). The Fortran version was reformulated,
significantly enhanced, and re-written in the C programming language
by Bahram Saghafian at the U.S. Army Construction Engineering
Research Laboratories. Implicit channel routing code was developed
and added to <I>r.hydro.CASC2D </I>by Fred L. Ogden (Ogden, 1994),
formerly at Colorado State University, now Asst. Professor, Department
of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Connecticut,
Storrs, Connecticut. This version became known as r.hydro.CASC2D,
part of the GRASS GIS for hydrologic simulations (Saghafian, 1993).
<P>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2> 
<P>
<I>r.hydro.CASC2D </I>is a physically-based, distributed, raster
hydrologic model which simulates the hydrologic response of a
watershed subject to a given rainfall field. Input rainfall is
allowed to vary in space and time. Major components of the model
include interception, infiltration, and surface runoff routing.
Interception is a process whereby rainfall is retained by vegetation.
Interception is estimated using an empirical three parameter model.
Infiltration is the process whereby rainfall or surface water
is pulled into the soil by capillary and gravity forces. The Green
and Ampt equation with four parameters is applied to model the
event-based infiltration. For continuous soil moisture accounting,
redistribution of soil moisture can also be simulated whenever
the non-intercepted rainfall intensity falls below the saturated
hydraulic conductivity of the soil. The redistribution option
requires two more soil hydraulic parameters. Excess rainfall becomes
surface runoff and is routed as overland flow and subsequently
as channel flow. The overland flow routing formulation is based
on a two-dimensional explicit finite difference (FD) technique,
while two different FD techniques, one explicit and one implicit,
provide options for routing one-dimensional channel flow. Through
a step function, a depression depth may be specified, below which
no overland flow will be routed.
<P>
The following sections describe various aspects of the model.
In executing the model, the likelihood of making a serious mistake
by an inexperienced user is unfortunately very high due to complexity
of input and output options. Thus the user must thoroughly read
all the details of this manual and then select appropriate options
for his or her needs. Since at this time GRASS is an integer GIS,
all input maps are stored in integer form. This requires conversion
from integer to floating point representation via a scaling factor.
The scaling factor for all floating point values is fixed. Therefore,
the integer maps of parameter values are created by multiplying
floating point values (e.g. volumetric water content) by a multiplier.

<P>
<B>FLAGS</B> 
<P>
There are several flags whose utility is driven by data availability
and/or user's choice.
<P>
<I>-s</I> do not check square tolerance of a grid cell. With this option
non-square grid cell can be simulated using width of east-west resolution.
<P>
<I>-m</I> r_gage_file units in mm/hr. Without this option r_gage_file units in
in/hr.
<P>
<I>-t</I> spatially interpolates raingage rainfall intensities
using Thiessen polygon technique. The default technique uses inverse-distance-squared
proportionality for interpolation of rainfall intensity over space.
<P>
<I>-o</I> routes edge-accumulated overland flow out of active
region (ONLY when no mask is specified). Often the surface water
accumulated at the edges of the current region creates severe
backwater effects and may limit the use of longer computational
time steps.
<P>
<I>-e</I> performs one-dimensional explicit finite difference
channel routing. May be suitable for low- to medium-intensity
rainstorms over small arid and semi-arid watersheds with no base
flow discharge. This option often limits the computational time
step to small values (&lt;10 seconds). Channel bed smoothing is
recommended to eliminate adverse slopes. No hydraulic structures,
except reservoir spillways, can be simulated.
<P>
<I>-p</I> assumes uniform channel geometry in each link (requires
-e option). If this option is chosen, the channel input file (channel_input)
must have only one line per fluvial link rather than the default
of one line per node.
<P>
<I>-i</I> performs Preissmann double sweep implicit channel routing.
Particularly suitable for watersheds with some base flow to avoid
dry-bed condition with channel slopes less than 1%. Supercritical
slopes cannot be handled; a warning message will be printed if
supercritical flow is encountered.
<P>
<I>-b</I> initializes the channel depth and discharge files (similar
to -d, requires -i option) using the standard step backwater method.
This option must be used with -i flag and replaces -d option to
write &quot;dis_profile&quot; and &quot;wat_surf_profile&quot;
files. At present, only link types 1, 2, and 8 may exist in the
channel network.
<P>
<I>-d</I> performs channel initialization for implicit routing
(similar to -b, requires -i option) by flooding the entire channel
network with a horizontal water surface and draining down to normal
depth using a y(t) outlet boundary condition (similar to -b).
It is essential for implicit channel routing technique that a
minimum initial base flow discharge exist in the channels and
also the corresponding initial water surface profile at each node
in the channel network have a realistic value. When the depth
at the outlet reaches normal depth, the values of depth and discharge
at each node is written to &quot;dis_profile&quot; and &quot;wat_surf_profile&quot;
files for use in start up of actual simulations. With this option
no other component of the model is executed; only the implicit
channel routing is performed to create initial depth and discharge
files necessary for start up of actual simulations.
<P>
<I>-u</I> writes discharges in cubic feet per second (cfs) and
volumes in cubic feet in &quot;discharge&quot; file. The internal
calculations are all in SI units regardless of this flag. The
default SI unit prints the discharges in cubic meters per second
(cms) and volumes in cubic meters (m3).
<P>
<I>-q</I> quietly skips printing iteration, time, and discharge
values to the screen. No status report is printed.
<P>
<H2>IMPORTANT NOTES</H2> 
<P>
The user must pay close attention to the following notes prior
to any simulation:
<P>
1) watershed_mask: Although optional, preparation of this map
is highly recommended as it cuts down on the memory requirements
by the amount directly proportional to the ratio of mask area
over the region area (also see -o flag). If the basin (mask) delineation
has not been performed correctly, surface water may accumulate
near the edges of the watershed. This excess water has no way
out of the watershed and will accumulate, creating undesirable
backwater effects within the watershed which eventually dictate
use of shorter time step in order to accommodate such effects.
It is recommended, in such instances, to re-delineate the watershed
along the edges. An alternative would be to lower the elevation
of the cells being flooded by excessive surface runoff near the
edges such that no artificial backwater is created.
<P>
2) elevation: The elevation map in the form of Digital Elevation
Model (DEM) is undoubtedly one of the most important inputs for
distributed modeling. Thus the quality of the DEM plays a major
role in success of distributed hydrologic simulations. DEMs almost
always contain errors. Large flat areas in the DEM may be due
to the limited vertical resolution of elevation data. Routing
over such flat areas usually creates problems for the numerical
techniques used in distributed physically-based models. Unreal
pits in the DEM may be artifacts of interpolation scheme used
to rasterize digitized contours, or due to coarse resolution in
areas of concave topography. As a rule of thumb, the user must
cross check the DEM with topographic maps of the area. One way
to discover potential errors in the DEM is to run <I>r.hydro.CASC2D
</I>iteratively with no other option except uniform rainfall and
a relatively short time step. Writing surface depth maps should
also be selected (see depth_map and write_time_step options).
The simulation may terminate normally, at which case the surface
depth maps must be examined in order to determine where most water
accumulation occurred and whether such accumulation areas is justified
by the topographic map of the area. Also stream network may be
checked for proper connectivity via depth maps. Alternatively,
if the model crashed at a certain location (whose address is printed
on the screen as well as at the bottom of discharge file) the
user must zoom in and double check the DEM with the topographic
map. Often times some manual editing of the DEM is necessary in
order to impose the actual drainage trend of the topo map. Prior
to editing it is recommended that the DEM be multiplied by 10
or 100, particularly if the original vertical resolution of the
DEM is also a concern. To account for this multiplication factor
use unit_el_conv=10 or unit_el_conv=100, whichever appropriate.
Note that only the unreal pits and depressions must be removed
since they most likely trap surface runoff which would have otherwise
contributed to the outlet. The real lakes and reservoirs may be
simulated if delineated (see lake_map). In any event, non-smoothed
DEMs require short computational time steps, while properly smoothed
DEMs, particularly those with coarser grid space resolution, allow
use of longer time steps. Another source of concern, which was
briefly mentioned in above paragraph, about the quality of the
DEMs is that a nicely connected stream network cannot be derived
from non-smoothed DEM. If no delineated network (in the form of
a vector file, for example) is available, an approach similar
to what was described before may be taken in order to edit the
DEM. However where a network has been delineated independent of
the DEM then the elevation of stream cells should be checked so
that they are not higher than those of the surrounding cells.
Otherwise the stream cells will not properly collect the surface
runoff.
<P>
3) initial_depth: This is a map which contains initial overland
depth values, if any. Rarely used since prior to the storm overland
planes are often dry. For channel initial depth see dis_profile
and wat_surf_profile options.
<P>
4) storage_capacity &amp; interception_coefficient: In r.hydro.CASC2D,
the interception rate (i) is expressed as:
<P>
<I>i(t)=r(t) while I &lt; a</I> 
<P>
<I>i(t)=b*r(t) while I &gt; a</I> 
<P>
where r(t) denotes rainfall intensity at time t; a is the storage
capacity; b is the interception coefficient; and I is the cumulative
interception depth. Storage capacity map, as well as interception
coefficient map, are usually a reclass of vegetation map. For
table of storage capacity and interception coefficient values
see Gray (1970, section 4.6) or Bras (1990) p. 233.
<P>
5) roughness_map: This map represents the spatial distribution
of overland Manning roughness coefficient n. This map could be
a reclass of vegetation cover map and/or the land use map. Tables
of Manning's n are available in most hydrology textbooks. By using
Manning resistance equation it is assumed that the overland flow
over watersheds satisfies the conditions of turbulent flow over
rough surfaces.
<P>
6) conductivity, capillary, porosity, &amp; moisture: Four soil
property maps are needed for modeling infiltration process using
the Green-Ampt technique. These maps respectively contain saturated
hydraulic conductivity, capillary suction head, effective porosity,
and initial soil moisture content. The first three maps may be
reclasses of soil texture map and the last one must be prepared
considering antecedent soil moisture conditions. Based on soil
textural classifications, tables of estimates of the first three
parameters can be found in Rawls et al. (1983). Wherever reliable
field measurements of such parameters are available they may be
substituted for table values. Note that the saturated hydraulic
conductivity map must be adjusted for the percent of rock fraction
within the soil, if known. If these four maps are specified, Green
&amp; Ampt infiltration calculations are performed. If one or
more of the maps is not specified, no infiltration calculations
are made.
<P>
7) pore_index &amp; residual_sat: These two maps are required
when continuous soil moisture accounting is of primary interest.
The model is capable of redistributing the soil moisture during
periods of no- or low- intensity rainfall, over which infiltration
capacity may recover for the next burst of storm intensity. The
technique used herein for hiatus and post-hiatus stages is primarily
based on the method by Smith el al. (1993). In this model Green-Ampt
equation is used for post-hiatus stage. Tables of pore-size distribution
index (Brooks &amp; Corey lambda) and residual saturation are
given by Rawls et al. (1982). As in (6), measured values should
be substituted where available. When the four maps specified in
(6) as well as the two maps specified here are given as command
line arguments, the redistribution infiltration routine is used.
All six maps must be specified to enable redistribution infiltration
calculations.
<P>
8) lake_map &amp; lake_elev: The first map is the delineated lake
map with different categories corresponding to individual lakes
and the second map holds the initial water surface elevation in
the lakes. It is best to number the lakes categories sequentially.
If a lake or reservoir connects to the implicit channel network
at its outlet, then the lake must also be numbered as a link as
reflected in the channel_input file. See channel_input and links_map
options for more details. However isolated pond areas may be simulated
as well; in fact such ponds are recommended to be delineated as
part of the lake_map. Such isolated lakes should not be present
in the links map since their outlet is not connected to the channel
network. The routing of the lakes is performed by linear reservoir
technique. Rainfall is added directly to the lake inflow. No interception
or infiltration is abstracted from the lake cells.
<P>
9) radar_intensity_map: This is the common prefix of radar- or
otherwise- generated rainfall maps. One possible source of this
type of data could be the NEXRAD system (Crum and Albery, 1993).
Alternatively, such time series of raster maps may come from the
output of an interpolation software, which takes in the rainfall
site data corresponding to different times and generates the time
series of raster maps. For instance, where raingage rainfall data
is available, one could run s.surf.rst of GRASS, one time for
every recording time, and save the interpolated rainfall maps
to be used as input for r.hydro.CASC2D. In any case one must pay
attention to the unit of intensity which is in integer millimeters
per hour for map values. Also see radar_time_step, and rain_duration
options. Example: If one sets radar_intensity_map=rain.map and
there are a total of eight maps in regular intervals of 10 minutes
(radar_time_step=600 and rain_duration= 4800, both in seconds),
then the actual name of the maps in the current mapset would have
to be: &quot;rain.map.1&quot;, &quot;rain.map.2&quot; through
&quot;rain.map.8&quot;, respectively corresponding to time periods
of 0-10, 10-20 through 70-80 minutes.
<P>
10) links_map &amp; nodes_map: A link is a channel segment, of
finite length, which is comprised of two or more computational
nodes placed at the center of each grid cell. Any internal boundary
condition (weirs and lakes/reservoirs, for example) is also considered
a link with only two nodes, one node upstream of the internal
link and one downstream. Although all links and nodes must be
numbered as discussed below, the link and node maps only contain
trapezoidal or look-up table cross sections (link types 1 and
8). Internal boundary condition link types (e.g. weirs) do not
appear in the link or node maps. The internal boundary condition
link types do appear in the channel_input file (see attachment).
The purpose of the link and node maps is to provide connectivity
information between overland flow grid cells and channel (link,node)
pairs. This information is used to pass overland flow to the 1-D
channel model as lateral inflow. The nodes map must contain the
node numbers corresponding to the links map. Thus nodes corresponding
to internal boundary condition links are not present in the nodes
map. At a cell where a link terminates and another link begins
(junctions for example) the node number must comply with the downstream
link; i.e. this cell is assigned a value of 1 in the nodes map.
However one must note that the last node of the upstream link
also lies at such junction cells. This last node number must be
accounted for in the main ascii channel data file (channel_input),
in which the total number of nodes per link must be given. An
exception to this rule is the most downstream link leading to
the outlet. The links map essentially describes topology of the
stream network and its strict conformation with the stream numbering
conventions is vital. Output from the GRASS command r.watershed
cannot be directly used in conjunction with r.hydro.CASC2D. The
link numbers assigned by r.watershed must be re-numbered in accordance
with the following rules. Additionally, the node map may be constructed
by re-numbering the link map. The general rules for link and node
numbering are:
<OL>
<LI>The first link is numbered 1.
<LI>Upstream links must have smaller link numbers than downstream
links.
<LI>Link numbers must change at junctions.
<LI>Link numbers may not be skipped.
<LI>Node numbers increase in the downstream direction.
<LI>Looped reaches cannot be simulated.
<LI>Streams may run only in x-y directions and not diagonally.
<LI>Link types cannot be mixed within a link.
</OL>

This network has three fluvial links, link 1 has 9 nodes in the
node map, while link 2 has 8 and link 3 has 5. Note that the junction
of links 1 and 2 is labeled link 3. However, links 1 and 2 have
hidden nodes at this junction, which must have the same bed elevation
as the first node in link 3, but different cross-sections. The
junction is really not the same point in space for all three links,
but really represents a short distance from the confluence. In
the channel_input file, link 1 really has 10 nodes and link 2
has 9. Link 3 would only have 5 nodes, because its downstream
end is not a junction, rather it is the watershed outlet. The
link and node maps tell <I>r.hydro.CASC2D </I>that the overland
flow in the grid cell at row 5, column 4 is passed to link 1,
node 5. For more discussion of links and nodes maps, see channel_input
description and the last section of this document for channel
input and table file options&quot;.
<P>
11) channel_input, table_file: For a detailed description of channel
data file set-up and requirements: see the last section of this
document which is a modified version of the document presented
at the CASC2D Workshop by F.L. Ogden, June 9-10, 1994, at the
University of Memphis, Tennessee (Revision 2, 10 January 1995).
Also it is recommended for the user to refer to Ogden (1994) for
an overview of the implicit channel routing formulation and numerical
scheme. Note that for explicit channel routing, the same channel
input file may be used provided that only link types 1 and 4 are
present. If explicit channel routing is used, the channel talweg
elevations are taken from the channel_input file, not from the
DEM.
<P>
12) dis_profile &amp; wat_surf_profile: These two files hold,
respectively, the discharge profile and the water surface profile
of all nodes within the stream network, including internal boundary
condition nodes. These files are created by running <I>r.hydro.CASC2D
</I>with the -i option AND either -d or -b. After creation, these
files are used to initialize the implicit channel routing scheme
for actual watershed simulations. They must be present for actual
simulations. The -d flag creates initial discharge and depth files
by flooding the entire channel network with a horizontal water
surface, and draining the network using a depth vs. time relation
at the watershed outlet. This draining proceeds until normal depth
is reached at the outlet. At this time, the dis_profile and wat_surf_profile
files are written for use in channel initialization for later
simulations. The -b flag creates the initialization files using
the standard step backwater method. Note that in dis_profile the
unit of discharge is in cubic meters per second and the unit of
depth in wat_surf_profile is in meters. Except for the reservoirs,
the water surface profile file actually holds the flow depth values
and thus is measured relative to the bed. CAUTION: The implicit
channel routing routine must have good first approximation of
depth and discharge at each node in the network. Inaccurate values
(guesses) will surely lead to a crash. Additionally, the implicit
channel routine is for SUBCRITICAL (Froude number &lt; 1) flow
only. A newly created channel input file will almost always crash
when first run. It is then the task of the user to identify the
location of the problem. Usually, there are regions of hydraulically
steep slopes which cause supercritical flow. The channel code
will warn the user of supercritical flow, including node and link
number when it occurs, and then exits. The user should look at
that node/link combination, and alter the data file to eliminate
the reach of steep slopes. One workable solution to prevent stability
problems at low flows is to use the so-called &quot;Preissmann
Slot&quot; (see Cunge et al., 1980, for example). Be patient,
as getting the channel network running is a time consuming process.
There are a host of possible errors including: abrupt changes
in cross-section, DEM-error, etc., which can cause problems. The
implicit routing method is not applicable to steep (mountainous
or upland) streams. If supercritical flow is encountered in upland
(1st order) streams, they can be eliminated from the network.
The user should verify the suitability of this approach on each
watershed.
<P>
13) hyd_location: If a filename is specified, this input ascii
file contains the link and node numbers of the locations at which
discharge hydrographs are to be written to the file named in the
dis_hyd_location option. The first column in this file should
contain link numbers and the second column must be filled with
the corresponding node numbers. For a description of the output,
see the dis_hyd_location option.
<P>
14) r_gage_file: This is an ascii file which must be provided
when raingage rainfall data is being simulated. At the top of
the file, two-column lines hold the easting and the northing for
each raingage. The number of such lines is determined by the total
number of recording raingages (num_of_raingages). The location
of any of the gages does not have to be within the current region
nor within the current watershed mask as long as the easting and
the northing are not specified relative to the current region,
but are based on absolute values in the UTM or SP coordinates.
If a gage falls outside in a different zone to the left of the
active region's zone, then negative values are also acceptable.
Note however that raingages well outside the watershed under analysis
generally provide poor rainfall estimates. The subsequent lines
at the bottom of the raingage file must reflect temporal variation
of rainfall intensity. The number of columns per line is equal
to the number of raingages (specified via num_of_raingages). The
columns are separated by space. The number of lines in this lower
portion is equal to number of instances, separated by a constant
time interval, the raingages have made a recording. As usually
is the case, the unit of rainfall intensity for raingage data
must be in inches per hour. Example: For three raingages, each
recording rainfall intensity every 2 minutes for a total duration
of, say, 10 minutes, a file called &quot;rain.inp&quot; may look
like this:
<P>
<TT>205150.0 750212.0</TT> 
<P>
<TT>20545.0 750104.0</TT> 
<P>
<TT>205320.0 750173.0</TT> 
<P>
<TT>0.0 0.0 0.55</TT> 
<P>
<TT>1.75 2.25 0.80</TT> 
<P>
<TT>1.00 1.80 1.50</TT> 
<P>
<TT>0.65 0.90 0.70</TT> 
<P>
<TT>0.0 0.50 0.30</TT> 
<P>
In above example, the eastings and northing of the first, second,
and third raingages are (205150.0,750212.0), (20545.0,750104.0),
and (205320.0,750173.0) respectively. The intensities recorded
by the first gage, for example, are 0.0, 1.75, 1.00, 0.65, and
0.0 inches per hour, respectively, over 0-2, 2-4, 4-6, 6-8, and
8-10 minutes, etc. For this example r_gage_file=rain.inp, num_of_raingages=3,
gage_time_step=120, and rain_duration=600. For state plane (SP)
coordinate system the eastings and northing will have to be in
feet rather than meters.
<P>
15) outlet_eastNnorthNslope: These three values determine
the location of the outlet, in terms of its easting and northing,
and the outlet bed slope. One needs to make sure that the outlet
described by its easting and northing is not only within the active
region but also inside watershed mask. Often times the region
is not set to its original settings after zoom-in operations (d.zoom)
are performed and this may put the outlet outside the active region
thus causing the model to eventually crash. The bed slope is equal
to tangent of the angle which is made between the bed profile
at the outlet and horizontal plane. This slope is primarily used
to calculate the outflow overland discharge at the outlet, if
any, based on normal depth boundary condition, when no channel
routing is performed (all surface flow treated as overland flow
and channels essentially assumed wide). Normal depth is also assumed
to prevail at the outlet when explicit channel routing (-e) has
been selected.
<P>
16) Manning_n: The alternative to simulating spatially varied
roughness coefficient is to provide a single value of Manning
roughness coefficient n via Manning_n parameter. The user is warned
if both roughness_map and Manning_n have been specified.
<P>
17) unif_rain_int: This option represents the intensity of the
spatially- uniform temporally-constant (up to the rainfall duration)
rainfall. Therefore this option may replace r_gage_file and radar_intensity_map
options. The unit is in millimeters per hour.
<P>
18) num_of_raingages: The total number of recording raingage.
If this variable is set to one, no spatial interpolation is performed
and the rainfall is treated as uniform is space but could vary
in time. The temporal variation will be then provided by r_gage_file.
Note that when num_of_raingages is set to one, the easting and
northing of the gage is irrelevant although two (arbitrary) values
must still be provided at the top of raingage file (r_gage_file).
<P>
19) time_step: This represents the duration of computational time
step in seconds and is a critical variable determining the total
execution time for a particular simulation. These is no firm guide
for the selection of the time step; it comes with experience and
strongly depends on watershed and rainfall characteristics. The
general rule for overland routing and explicit channel routing
is that shorter time steps must be used for higher intensity storms,
finer horizontal grid resolution (grid spacing), steeper watershed
slopes, larger watershed areas, and smoother surfaces. Stability
of explicit routing depends upon Courant number. Unfortunately,
the critical condition for Courant number limits the length of
the computational time step which must be used for the entire
simulation unless variable time step algorithm is implemented
in the future. Shorter time steps must be used when backwater
effects are generated, mainly in flat areas which are not part
of the lake map. If the time step is too long for any particular
simulation the surface water depth in completely flat areas may
show a checker-board pattern, i.e. oscillations are observed in
the water surface level. This eventually results in a crash. As
such, the time step should be decreased and the simulation repeated;
or the flat areas be delineated within the lake map.
<P>
20) gage_time_step: This variable represents the time interval,
in seconds, between recording instances of rainfall intensities
by raingage(s). It is implied that the rainfall data has been
recorded in regular intervals. See the notes under r_gage_file
for an example.
<P>
21) radar_time_step: A value expressing the time interval between
consecutive rainfall maps. A uniform time step is implied.
<P>
22) rain_duration: This is the total duration of rainfall in seconds.
If multistorm events are simulated, the time from the beginning
of the first storm to the end of the last storm constitutes the
total rainfall duration. As such, selection of soil moisture redistribution
capability is recommended via specifying pore index (pore_index)
and residual saturation (residual_sat) maps.
<P>
23) tot_time: The total simulation time in seconds. If the falling
limb of the discharge hydrograph is of particular interest the
total simulation time must be set to a value greater than total
rainfall duration plus the expected recession time.
<P>
24) write_time_step: This time parameter determines the frequency
of writing output raster maps and is equal to the time interval,
in seconds, at which output raster maps are saved. Also see depth_map,
inf_depth_map, surf_moist_map, rate_of_infil_map, and dis_rain_map
output options.
<P>
25) unit_el_conv: This conversion factor is used to convert elevation
values in DEM (elevation) map to meters. This parameter doesn't
need to be specified if the DEM is already in meters since the
default is one. For DEM units in cm or ft, unit_el_conv must be
respectively set to 100 or 3.281.
<P>
26) unit_lake: This conversion factor is used to convert the water
surface elevation values in the lake_elev map to meters. The default
is 1.0.
<P>
27) unit_space: This conversion factor is used to convert the
horizontal grid spacing resolution to meters. The default is 1.0.
For state plane coordinate system in ft, set unit_space equal
to 3.281.
<P>
28) d_thresh: This parameter represents an average step retention
storage below which the overland depth will not be routed. Another
words, all depressions less than or equal to d_thresh are filled
before any overland flow could begin. The unit must be in meters
so for 2 mm of depression storage set d_thresh=0.002. Higher values
of depression storage would reduce the total execution time of
the model as the overland routing consumes most of the CPU effort.
<P>
29) discharge: The discharge hydrograph computed at the outlet
will be saved in this ascii file under the current directory.
Some other information, such as peak discharge, is also printed
in this file.
<P>
30) dis_hyd_location: Whenever the hyd_location option is selected,
the discharge at individual node/link pairs will be saved in this
file. The discharge hydrographs at the (link,node) locations specified
in hyd_location file are grouped in columns. The number of lines
in this file is determined by the total number of iterations equal
to tot_time divided by time_step.
<P>
31) depth_map, inf_depth_map, surf_moist_map, rate_of_infil_map,
&amp; dis_rain_map: depth_map is the common filename prefix given
to the time series of output raster maps containing surface depth
values in millimeters. At the channel cells the channel flow depth
will be recorded in the maps. The surface depth maps, and all
other output maps, are saved at regular intervals determined by
write_time_step option. If write_time_step is not set, no output
raster map will be saved. The first map always corresponds to
the initial condition and naturally shows the water surface profile
corresponding to the base flow discharge within the channel network
when implicit channel routing is performed. Similarly the last
depth map corresponds to the end-of-simulation time, or to the
time at which the program finished abnormally, for example due
to selection of a long step which generated oscillations leading
to a crash. Abnormal program termination caused by oscillating
depths may show negative depths in the overland plane. There is
a hard-coded limit of 2000 output raster maps for each simulation.
inf_depth_map and rate_of_infil_map are two options to save the
output raster maps of cumulative infiltration depth, in tenth
of mm, and rate of infiltration in mm/hr, respectively. These
two options can only be selected when infiltration is being computed
via either the Green &amp; Ampt or redistribution methods. surf_moist_map
output contains the soil moisture values at the soil surface and
it may solely be selected with continuous infiltration option
(pore_index and residual_sat maps are specified). dis_rain_map
option saves the instantaneous rainfall intensities, in mm/hr,
at write_time_step intervals and may be set for the simulations
involving spatially distributed rainstorms; i.e. raingage rainfall
data or radar (or other sources of rainfall raster maps) data.
Example: If one sets depth_map=depth.out, tot_time=1000, and write_time_step=
100, then a total of 11 raster depth maps will be saved in a normally-terminated
simulation: depth.out.00, depth.out.01, depth.out.02 through depth.out.10,
respectively corresponding to times equal to 0, 100, 200, through
1000 seconds. These maps may be viewed sequentially in animation
form using the GRASS animator program xganim.
<P>
<H2>GENERAL NOTES FOR CHANNEL_INPUT AND TABLE_FILE FILE OPTIONS</H2>

<P>
The naming convention associated with the Preissmann double-sweep
1-D implicit channel routing method is based on the concept to
links and nodes. A link is a channel segment, or an internal boundary
condition, which is comprised of two or more computational nodes.
All internal boundary conditions contain two nodes, while fluvial
reaches may be of any size greater than or equal to two nodes.
The following discussion of input file format must first distinguish
between different link types. A few of the possible link types
are presented below in Table 1. As of August 1995, only link types
1, 2, 4, and 8 are supported. Development is continuing on link
types 3 and 7.
<P>
Table 1. Link Types
<P>
<PRE>
Link    Description              Number of        Number of
Type    of Link Type             Parameters       Nodes

1 Fluvial Link, 
  Trapezoidal Cross-Section          5             &gt;=2
2 Overflow Weir                      8               2
3 Culvert/Weir (not yet supported)   8               2
4 Reservoir                          5               2
7 Bridge Crossing (not yet supported) 8              2
8 Fluvial Link, Look-up Table (Breakpoint) 4        &gt;=2
  Cross-Section
</PRE>
</P>
At present the channel model formulation accepts cross-sectional
input for only two different channel geometries, namely trapezoidal,
and breakpoint via look-up table. Trapezoidal channel parameters
which must be provided as input at each computation node include:
Manning's n, bottom width, channel depth, side slope, and bed
elevation. Look-up tables of cross sectional properties must include
cross-sectional area, top width, and conveyance at equal depth
intervals. Smooth transition in channel cross sectional properties
within links of type 8 and between all connecting fluvial links
often plays a vital role in the success of simulations. Abrupt
changes in cross-sections can lead to numerical errors in mass
conservation.
<P>
As far as handling the reservoirs (link type 4), flow is not routed
through reservoirs in this version of the CASC2D channel routing
code. Instead the linear reservoir approximation is used. Among
other internal boundary conditions link types, only weirs can
be simulated at present.
<P>
The channel_input file contains the channel bed elevation at each
node, which constructs the longitudinal profile of channels in
the drainage network. Ideally, the modeler should use surveyed
cross sections and talweg profiles of the channel network. However,
extensive surveys are often impossible for the entire drainage
networks on large watersheds. In lieu of an extensive survey,
there are existing tools for extracting channel topology from
digital elevation models (DEM). However, if the channel network
is extracted from a DEM, a smoothing algorithm must be applied
(e.g. Ogden et al., 1994) to produce physically realistic longitudinal
profiles because of errors inherent in any DEM.
<P>
<B>EXAMPLE OF INPUT FILE FORMAT AND CONSTRUCTION</B> 
<P>
NOTE: The channel_input file and table_file both follow SI unit
convention. All units of length are in meters, including elevations.
<P>
In this example, a channel input data file is constructed for
a fictitious watershed. Note that this particular example is merely
for demonstration and has not been tried in any simulation run.
The stream network will consist of trapezoidal and look-up table
fluvial links, an internal reservoir, and an overflow weir. Regarding
the MASK map (watershed_mask option), note that all watershed
cells must be marked with 1, while all raster cells outside the
watershed boundary are marked with 0. Also all the cells in the
lake should carry the value 1 on the LAKE map (lake_map option).
If there was another lake in this example, it would be denoted
with the number 2, etc.
<P>
The channel link numbering scheme typically employed in double-sweep
routing was explained in the main text. With reference to the
LINK map shown below, (links_map option), assume that links 1
and 2 drain into link 3, which in-turn drains in to the lake,
which is assigned link number 4. Also links 7 and 8 drain into
link 9. Link 5 originates at the outlet of the reservoir. Link
5 is split into link 6 because of a change in some cross-section
property. Links 6 and 9 flow into link 10, which is immediately
upstream from a weir which must be considered link 11. Finally,
link 12, the most downstream link, lies below the weir (link 11).
Note that the LINK map contains continuous sequence of link numbers,
except for the internal boundary conditions such as the weir (link
11) and lakes (link 4) which does not appear in the LINK map.

Now, refer to the NODE map (nodes_map option) shown below. In
the NODE map, each link is numbered from 1 to the number of grid
cells spanned by that link, with the exception of the internal
boundary conditions. Conceptually, internal boundary conditions
(including reservoirs) have two nodes but they are not given any
node numbers in the NODE map. This is how the program recognizes
internal boundary conditions. Furthermore, all links except the
one leading to the watershed outlet must have an extra node to
provide connectivity to the downstream link. Therefore, even though
the NODE map may show link 1 to have 13 nodes, it actually has
14. This implied extra node for link 1, shared between the most
downstream node of link 1 and the most upstream node of link 3,
provides the connection between link 1 and link 3. The number
of nodes in each link in this example are shown below in Table
2. Note that the node map entries for the lake (link 4) are 0.

The first portion of the channel input file is used to pass physical
constants and simulation parameters to the model. These include
the gravitational acceleration &quot;g&quot;, kinetic energy correction
factor &quot;alpha&quot;, the friction slope weighting factor
&quot;beta&quot;, the spatial derivative weighting coefficient
&quot;theta&quot;, the length of each node &quot;dx&quot;, the
computational time step &quot;dt&quot; (seconds), the total simulation
time &quot;tt&quot; (seconds), and the discharge in all first
order streams &quot;qmin&quot; (m3/s). At present, the time step
&quot;dt&quot; must be identical to the computational time step
used in the overland flow routing portion of r.hydro.CASC2D. The
program must be told the number of links, and the largest number
of nodes in any link in the network for dynamic memory allocation.
In our example problem, the number of links is 12, and the maximum
number of nodes is 14 (in link 1). Remember that all links which
are not at the outlet or not immediately upstream of a reservoir
must have an extra node for connectivity purposes. The total number
of links is called &quot;nlinks&quot;, and the largest number
of nodes in any link in the network is called &quot;maxnodes&quot;.
In this example, we will use the constants and parameters given
in Table 3:

<P>
This data constitutes the first portion of channel_input file
and is arranged into a header which must have the form (note floating
point and integers):
<P>
<TT>9.81</TT> 
<P>
<TT>1.0 0.5 0.55</TT>

<P>
The second portion of the input file describes link types as well
as the network topology and connectivity. This is accomplished
using a line-input format, one line for each link in the network.
Each line contains 6 values arranged in columns, as shown in Table
4.
<P>
Table 4. Connectivity information format
<P>
<TT>Column Data Description</TT> 
<P>
<TT>1 Link number (INT)</TT> 
<P>
<TT>2 Link type (INT)</TT>

<P>
<TT>5 Upstream link #2 (INT) (0 if no or only one upstream link)</TT>

<P>
<TT>6 Downstream link (0 for outlet ) (INT)</TT> 
<P>
As far as link types in the current example, assume that links
1 through 9, except reservoir link 4 (link type 4), are well-described
as trapezoidal (type 1), and we are using look-up table data to
describe the cross-sections of links 10 and 12 (type 8). The weir
(link 11) is of link type 2. Thus the second portion of input
file for describing link types and connectivity looks like:
<P>
<TT>1 1 0 0 0 3</TT> 
<P>
<TT>2 1 0 0 0 3</TT> 
<P>
<TT>3 1 2 1 2 4</TT> 
<P>
<TT>4 4 1 3 0 5</TT>

<P>
<TT>11 2 1 10 0 12</TT> 
<P>
<TT>12 8 1 11 0 0</TT> 
<P>
Note that only the outlet link has 0 as a downstream dependency.
It is important that this be the only link with 0 as a downstream
dependency. Also, the location and topology of internal boundary
condition links (4 and 11) with respect to other links are known
via above connectivity information in the channel_input file.
As an interpretation, examine link number 10 above. It is of link
type 8 (look-up table cross-section data), has 2 upstream dependencies
(links 6 and 9), and flows into link 11.
<P>
The third portion of the input file contains the individual hydraulic
property information for each node in the network. Assume for
now that all the trapezoidal channels in the network have the
properties shown in Table 5.
<P>
Table 5. Cross-Sectional Properties of Example Trapezoidal Channels

<P>
Now, build the input file section for link #1 which has 13 nodes
on the NODE map, plus an extra for connectivity at the upstream
end of link 3 (total of 14 nodes). This input file section will
look like:
<P>
<TT>1 14</TT> 
<P>
<TT>0.035 2.10 1.75 2.00 264.40</TT>

<P>
<TT>0.035 2.40 1.75 2.15 261.00</TT> 
<P>
The 1 and 14 on the first line indicate that it is link 1, with
14 nodes. The columns represent Manning's n, bottom width, channel
depth, trapezoidal side slope H/V, and talweg elevation, respectively.
<P>
Link 2 might have an entry which looks like:
<P>
<TT>2 11</TT> 
<P>
<TT>0.035 1.80 1.75 1.80 264.21</TT>

<P>
<TT>0.035 2.30 1.75 2.10 261.00</TT> 
<P>
The cross-section entry for link 3 would then look like:
<P>
<TT>3 4</TT> 
<P>
<TT>0.035 2.60 1.75 2.20 261.00</TT> 
<P>
<TT>0.035 2.60 1.75 2.40 260.20</TT>

<P>
<TT>0.035 2.80 1.75 2.90 259.17</TT> 
<P>
The elevation of the downstream end of links 1 and 2 must be equal
to the bed elevation of the upstream end of link 3. It is required
that the bed elevation of all channel inverts at each junction
be equal. Even though they are not exactly the same points in
space, they are assumed close enough to have the same elevation.

<P>
The input for other links with trapezoidal cross section is similar
to the input for link 1 (see the next section for the complete
input file).
<P>
Additionally, assume that the reservoir (link 4) has a surface
area of 0.498 square km, a rectangular spillway width of 12m,
a spillway discharge coefficient of 0.97, an initial water surface
elevation of 260.10m, and a spillway crest elevation of 260.50m.
The resulting input file entry is shown below.
<P>

<P>
<TT>0.000 0.0 0.00 0.00 0.00</TT> 
<P>
The number of nodes (line entries) in the channel_input file per
reservoir link is two, but the numbers entered in the second row
entry are for further improvements and for now their value is
irrelevant. Also note that the bed elevation at the downstream
limit of link 3 MUST be lower than the initial water surface elevation
in the reservoir (link 4). This is mandatory at all downstream
boundaries between channels flowing into the reservoirs. Reservoirs
serve as downstream boundary conditions at upstream links. The
elevation of reservoirs should therefore never be allowed to fall
below critical depth in any channels which flow into the reservoir.
If this happens, the code will crash.
<P>
The input for links 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 will be similar to links
1, 2, and 3. See the constructed input file at the end of this
text. Trapezoidal channel links are simple in terms of input.
The channel depth field is intended to represent the average bank-full
depth of the channel. This number is not used in the present version
of the code, but will be in the future when the overland flood
plane and channel flows are coupled iteratively. At present the
flows are not fully coupled. Water can flow only from the overland
flow plane into the channels, not from the channels back to the
flood plane.
<P>
If look-up table data are used (link type 8), the look-up tables
are stored in a separate file. The GRASS command line option for
this look-up table file is table_file. If there are any link type
8 in the channel_input data file, the program will attempt to
open the file table_file (typically called &quot;table.dat&quot;).
If this file is not present, the program will terminate. In channel_input
file, all that is needed is the table number for a particular
cross section, and the talweg elevation. Assume that the 4 nodes
in link 10 are approximated by one cross-section, which is given
as table entry 1, then the channel_input file entry for link 10
would look like:
<P>
<TT>10 4</TT> 
<P>
<TT>1 244.0 1 243.5 1 243.0 1 242.5</TT> 
<P>
In this format, the first column represents the look-up table
number for the given node, and the second column represents the
bed elevation for that node. Table numbers can be mixed within
a link. However, abrupt changes in cross-section should be avoided
because they cause significant continuity errors in the formulation.
The format of the table_file is discussed later in this document.
<P>
Link 11 is an overflow weir link. While this link has no nodes
which appear in the node map for overland flow connectivity, it
does have two nodes in terms of channel topology. The meaning
of the columns in the weir node input section is presented in
Table 6.
<P>
Table 6. Parameter Description for Weirs
<P>

<P>
<TT>1 1 forward direction weir discharge coefficient</TT> 
<P>
<TT>1 2 reverse direction weir discharge coefficient</TT>

<P>
<TT>2 1-4 0.0 (reserved for future use)</TT> 
<P>
<TT>2 5 downstream bed elevation, meters</TT> 
<P>
The first (upstream) node represents the crest of the rectangular
weir. The second (downstream) node represents the bed of the channel
just downstream from the weir. Assume that this weir has a crest
elevation of 244.4 m, a crest width of 8 m, a discharge coefficient
in the forward direction of 0.92, a discharge coefficient for
flow in the reverse direction equal to 0.85, and the channel bed
elevation immediately downstream from the weir is 239.8m. The
entry for this weir in the channel_input file would thus appear
as:
<P>
<TT>11 2</TT> 
<P>
<TT>0.92 0.85 0.00 8.00 244.4</TT> 
<P>
<TT>0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 239.8</TT> 
<P>
Link 12 uses table entry 2 for the its first four nodes and entry
4 for the remaining two nodes. Note that link 12 has 6 nodes in
the node map, and 6 nodes in the channel_input file. Because link
12 is the outlet link, we do not add an extra node at the downstream
end for connectivity purposes. The portion of the channel_input
file for link 12 looks like:
<P>
<TT>12 6</TT> 
<P>
<TT>2 239.80</TT> 
<P>
<TT>2 239.47</TT> 
<P>
<TT>2 239.33</TT> 
<P>
<TT>2 239.05</TT> 
<P>
<TT>3 238.54</TT> 
<P>
<TT>3 238.44</TT> 
<P>
Hence, 238.44 is the talweg elevation at the outlet of the catchment.
Also notice that the upstream end of link 12 and the downstream
node of link 11 have the same bed elevation.
<P>
Weirs cannot be used as the outlet boundary condition for this
channel model. If your watershed has a weir at the outlet, just
place a short link downstream from the weir with appropriate characteristics.

<B>TABLE_FILE INPUT FORMAT</B> 
<P>
If link type 8 (look-up table x-sections) are present in the channel_input
file, we require a file typically called &quot;table.dat&quot;,
to store all look-up table values. This file must begin with an
integer equal to the number of tables contained within the file.
In our example this number is 3. Then we require 3 tables. The
first line of each table is an integer equal to the table number.
The second line in the table entry contains two numbers, an integer,
and a floating point (real) value. The first number is equal to
the number of entries (rows) in each particular table, designated
by &quot;numhts&quot;. The second number is the vertical distance
between hydraulic property points, which must be a constant for
each table. For instance, if you describe the variation of cross-sectional
area, topwidth, and conveyance at 0.5 m vertical intervals, this
number will be 0.5.
<P>
Each table entry must then contain &quot;numhts&quot; lines, each
with four entries. The first line must be:
<P>
<TT>0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0</TT> 
<P>
subsequent lines must contain the following:
<P>
<TT>height topwidth x-section_area x-section_conveyance.</TT>

<P>
For instance, assume we know geometric variables for table entries
1, 2, and 3. The file &quot;table.dat&quot; (table_file option)
may look like:

For further clarification, consider table 2 above, corresponding
to cross sectional properties of the four most upstream nodes
of link 12. Table 2 has 8 entries, each separated by 0.5 meter
of depth. At a depth of 3.0 m, for example, the channel has a
top-width of 9.2m, a cross-sectional area of 86.4 m2, and a conveyance
of 312.5 m3/s. The conveyance K is used to calculate the discharge
using:
<P>
<I>Q=K*sqrt(Slope)</I> 
<P>
Where using Manning's equation, K is defined (in SI units) as:
<P>
<I>K = 1/n * (Area) * (Hydraulic_radius)^(2/3)</I> 
<P>
These tables can be produced easily using a spreadsheet using
measured channel cross-section data.
