<H2>NAME</H2>

<EM><b>p.ppm</b></EM>  - Reads portable pixmap (ppm) files created by PPM utilities.

<BR>

<EM>(GRASS Paint/Print Program) </EM>

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>p.ppm</B>

<BR>

<B>p.ppm help</B>

<BR>

<B>p.ppm </B>[<B>-f</B>] [<B>input=</B><EM>name</EM>]

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

This program, <EM>p.ppm</EM>, reads a user-specified portable pixmap
(ppm) file and outputs it to the currently selected printer
(see <EM><A HREF="p.select.html">p.select</A></EM>).
The <EM>input</EM> ppm file should be one that has been created
using the PPM utilities developed by Jeff Poskanzer.
These utilities can import various image formats (including Sun raster,
X Windows pixmaps, and others) into the PPM formats <EM>ppm</EM>
(color pixmaps), <EM>pgm</EM> (grey scale maps), and <EM>pbm</EM>
(black and white bit-maps).


<P>

If the image doesn't fit the output device, it won't get printed.
If you want the image printed (but clipped), use the <B>p.ppm -f</B> option,
or scale the input using <EM>ppmscale</EM>,
or rotate the image using <EM>ppmrotate</EM>
(if it will fit that way -- otherwise you might have to scale it as well).
If the image doesn't fit, <EM>p.ppm</EM> will tell you what
scaling value to enter to <EM>ppmscale</EM> that will make it fit.


<P>


<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

If the user is running GRASS under SunOS, the following command
could be used to send a monitor screen image to the printer:


<P>

<DL>
<DD>
<B>screendump | rasttoppm | p.ppm </B>
</DL>


<P>



<P>

If you are running suntools, the user might type:


<P>

<DL>
<DD>
<B>sleep 10; screendump | rasttoppm | ppmrotate 90 | p.ppm </B>
</DL>


<P>

The UNIX <EM>sleep</EM> command allows you time to arrange the frames
before the screen dump starts.
The <EM>ppmrotate</EM> is usually needed because the Sun screens
are wider than they are long
(and wider than 1024 pixels - which is the width of most of our printers).


<P>

If you are running X, the user might type:


<P>

<DL>
<DD>
<B>xwd | xwdtoppm | ppmrotate 90 | p.ppm </B>
</DL>

<H2>NOTES</H2>

This program only supports the ppm binary format (P6).


<P>

Maximum color level is 255.  If the ppm file has more color
levels, use <EM>ppmcscale</EM> to reduce the number of colors.


<P>

No scaling is done.  Use <EM>ppmscale</EM> to change image size.


<P>

No rotation is done.  Use <EM>ppmrotate</EM> to rotate the image.
