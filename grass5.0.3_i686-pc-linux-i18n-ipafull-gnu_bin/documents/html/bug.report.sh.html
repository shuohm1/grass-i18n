<H2>NAME</H2>

<EM><b>bug.report.sh</b></EM>  - A mechanism for writing, storing,
and e-mailing bug reports on GRASS 5 commands.

<BR>

<EM>(GRASS Shell Script)</EM>

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>bug.report.sh </B><EM>module_name</EM> [<EM>module_arguments</EM>]

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>bug.report.sh</EM>
is a Bourne shell (sh(1)) script which, when given a GRASS 5 module name,
allows the user to complete a bug report for that program.
Completed bug reports can be e-mailed to the GRASS development Team
(<a href=http://intevation.de/rt/webrt?q_queue=grass>GRASS Bug report
system</a>), saved to a file in the user's home directory, 
or discarded.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

This program is not interactive;  the user must specify the name of a
5.x module on the command line.  Program arguments can optionally be
entered by the user.

<H3>Parameters:</H3>

<DL>

<DT><EM>module_name</EM> 

<DD>The name of an existing GRASS version 5 program tested by the user.

<DT><EM>module_argument(s)</EM> 

<DD>Program arguments (parameters and/or flags) for the
<EM>module_name</EM> tested by the user.  The user
should enter whatever command arguments were actually run
when the program bug occurred.

</DL>

<H2>EXAMPLE</H2>

For example, if the user wished to complete a bug report on 
<EM><A HREF="../html/v.to.rast.html">v.to.rast</A></EM>
after running the program, the user might then type:

<DL>
<DD>
<B>bug.report.sh </B>v.to.rast 
</DL>

A standard bug report form would then be displayed on the
user's text terminal, containing the user's current GRASS
region settings, and the machine name, GRASS data base,
location, and mapset, on which the user is currently
running GRASS.  Program parameters and flag settings, and
the command entered by the user on the command line, are
also automatically entered on the bug report form.  The
user is put into a text editor and expected to enter
additional information describing the nature of the bug
found or the results of program testing.

<P>

The user is then asked whether the completed bug report is to be:
<DL>
<DD>
1 - mailed to grass-bugs@intevation.de
<BR>
2 - added to the file <KBD>grass.bugs</KBD> in the user's home directory
<BR>
3 - both 1 and 2
<BR>
4 - thrown away
</DL>

<H2>NOTES</H2>

This program prints whatever region settings, GRASS data
base, location, and mapset are current when the user runs
<EM>bug.report.sh</EM>.  The user is therefore advised to
run <EM>bug.report.sh</EM> immediately after experiencing a
program bug, to ensure that the settings current when the
bug occurred are reported on the bug report form.
<p>
Note, that the $EDITOR environment variable is used to define the
editor. The "vi" editor is the default editor.

<H2>FILES</H2>

This shell script is stored under the <KBD>$GISBASE/scripts</KBD>
directory on the user's system.  The user is encouraged to
examine the shell script commands stored in this directory
and to produce similar scripts for their own use.
