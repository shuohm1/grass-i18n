<H2>NAME</H2>

<EM><b>i.tape.tm</b></EM>  - An
<A HREF="../imagery.html">imagery</A> function that extracts
LANDSAT Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery from half-inch tape.

<BR>

<EM>(GRASS Image Processing Program)</EM>

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>i.tape.tm</B>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>i.tape.tm</EM>
is a program that extracts LANDSAT Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery from
half-inch tape.

<P>

This program must be run in a LOCATION_NAME with a x,y
coordinate system (i.e., a coordinate system with
projection 0).  For further information regarding this
LOCATION_NAME refer to the

<EM><A HREF="../imagery.html">imagery</A></EM> manual entry.


<P>

The first prompt in <EM>i.tape.tm</EM> asks the user for
the tape device name.  This is sometimes  /dev/rmt0 (for a
half-inch tape having a density of 1600 bpi), but this
varies with each machine.

<P>

The next prompt is:

<PRE>
Please mount and load tape, then hit RETURN --&gt;
</PRE>

<B>IMAGE IDENTIFICATION MENU</B>
<P>
The first menu in the program asks the user for information about the data.


<PRE>
     please enter the following information

Tape Identification:                             __

Image Description:                               __

Title for the Extracted Raster (Cell) Files:     __

AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT &lt;ESC&gt; TO CONTINUE
              (OR &lt;Ctrl-C&gt; TO CANCEL)
</PRE>

This program automatically enters the scene ID number into
the field for Tape Identification.  The mission, path, row,
quadrant, date, and whether the image is corrected is
automatically entered into the field for Image
Description.

<P>

The second menu is:

<PRE>
              THEMATIC MAPPER EXTRACT
please select the desired tape window (geographic 
region definition) to extract

             first row: _______(1-2984)
             last row: _______(1-2984)

             first col: _______(1-4220)
             last col: _______(1-4220)


AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT &lt;ESC&gt; TO CONTINUE
              (OR &lt;Ctrl-C&gt; TO CANCEL)
</PRE>

The numbers in parentheses are the total number of rows and
columns on the tape including zeros (filler).  This
information and additional information can also be obtained
by running the program

<EM><A HREF="m.examine.tape.html">m.examine.tape</A></EM>.
<EM><A HREF="m.examine.tape.html">m.examine.tape</A></EM> 

will read any tape and provide the user with the number of
files on a tape, the number of records on a tape, and the
record lengthes.  Any subset of the image on the tape may
be extracted.  For a discussion of row and column
extraction see the subheading enTITLEd 
ROW AND COLUMN EXTRACTION below.

<P>

The next menu is:

<PRE>
  please make an x by the bands you want extracted

                      _____ 1
                      _____ 2
                      _____ 3
                      _____ 4
                      _____ 5
                      _____ 6
                      _____ 7

AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT &lt;ESC&gt; TO CONTINUE
              (OR &lt;Ctrl-C&gt; TO CANCEL)
</PRE>

TM imagery has 7 bands, but the user may want to extract
only a subset of these bands.  See the subheading in this
entry enTITLEd 
ROW AND COLUMN EXTRACTION.


<P>

The user then is asked to enter the prefix/group for the
raster band files to be created.  This name will precede
each band file extracted into GRASS.  For example, if three
bands are extracted the following three band files will
result:


<P>

<EM>prefixname.1</EM>

<BR>

<EM>prefixname.2</EM>

<BR>

<EM>prefixname.3</EM>


<P>

The specified <EM>prefixname</EM>
will also automatically become the name for the 
<A HREF="i.group.html">imagery</A> group 
file being created.  Each image or quad (i.e., each run of <EM>i.tape.tm</EM>)
should be given a unique prefix/group name.


<P>

The extraction process will begin by first skipping the
number of specified files, advancing to the first band
requested, and then reading the tape.  After extracting the
requested rows and columns for each band, the program
creates support files for the raster band map layer.  The
percent completion of the extraction is displayed on the
screen.  Because TM imagery is divided into four quads and
is stored in multiple tape sets, the program is designed to
read one quad at a time.  The number of tapes required to
store one quad depends on the number of bytes per inch in
which the data is stored.  If more than one tape is
required to store one quad, the program will pause and
inform the user to mount the next tape.


<P>

The extracted band files will be listed as raster map layers
available in the current MAPSET and may be displayed using the GRASS
commands 

<EM><A HREF="d.display.html">d.display</A></EM>, 

<EM><A HREF="d.rast.html">d.rast</A></EM> or 

<EM><A HREF="i.points.html">i.points</A></EM>.

<H2>NOTES</H2>

After extracting an image from tape the geographic region definition
in the x,y coordinate LOCATION_NAME will be set based upon the 
extracted rows and columns from the tape.  The relationship between
the image rows and columns and the coordinates of the geographic region
is discussed in the 

<EM><A HREF="../imagery.html">imagery</A></EM> manual entry.


<P>

This program is interactive and requires no command line arguments.

<H2>ROW AND COLUMN EXTRACTION</H2>

The display options in GRASS allow the user to locate rows and
columns on the digital image.  If enough disk space is available, one
band of an entire image or, one band of a portion of an image known to 
contain the area of interest, can be extracted and displayed.  The 
<EM>measurements</EM>
option in 

<EM><A HREF="d.display.html">d.display</A></EM>, or 

<EM><A HREF="d.where.html">d.where</A></EM> 

(following use of <EM><A HREF="d.rast.html">d.rast</A></EM>)
will echo x and y coordinates to the screen.  (These coordinates will
display negative numbers in the north-south direction, but ignoring the
negative sign will yield the row number.)  See the 

<EM><A HREF="../imagery.html">imagery</A></EM> manual
entry for further explanation.


<P>

Each quad of a TM image contains filler on both the left
and right sides of the quad.  The user may want to identify
the row and column numbers in order to exclude the filler.
This filler will otherwise be extracted with the image and
take up unnecessary disk space.


<P>

If a photograph of the digital image is available, the rows
and columns to be extracted can be determined from it by
associating inches with the total number of known rows and
columns in the scene.  For example, if the total length of
the photograph is 12 inches, the total number of rows on
the tape is 2000, and the northwest corner of the area of
interest begins 2 inches from the top of the photo, then:


<DL>
<DD>12" / 2000 rows = 2" / x rows
<DD>x = 333.333
</DL>

The northwest corner of the area of interest starts at row
333.  The starting row, ending row, starting column, and
ending column can be calculated in this manner.
