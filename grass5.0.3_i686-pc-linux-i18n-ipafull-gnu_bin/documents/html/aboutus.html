<b>Introduction</b><br>

The GRASS Development Team is pleased to announce this new home for the open
source Geographic Resources Analysis Support System (GRASS).  GRASS has been
under continual development since 1982 and has involved a large number of
federal US agencies, universities, and private companies.  The core
components of GRASS and the management of the integration of the efforts
into GRASS releases were accomplished by the Construction Engineering
Resesarch Laboratory (CERL) in Champaign, Illinois.  CERL completed the last
combined release of GRASS as version 4.1 in 1992 and provided updates and
patches to this release through 1995.  It has been estimated that several
million dollars of GRASS software development efforts across the government
have been completed since the 4.1 release. Since 1997 GRASS is developed by
a consortium of worldwide researcher and programmers at universities and
private companies. GRASS GIS is released under GNU General Public License.

<p>
<b>Plans</b><br>
We have several goals for the release of GRASS including:
<ul>
<li><i>We have released GRASS version 4.2.x</i>
GRASS 4.2.x consists of the GRASS 4.1 engine with the addition of many new
programs that have been submitted by the user community.<p>

<li><i>Revamped documentation.</i>
In keeping with the tradition of making GRASS available to the greatest
audience possible, are releasing new versions of the documentation. The
current Users, Programmers, and Installation Guides are currently available
in Adobe PDF format.<p>

<li><i>The release of version 5.0.</i>
Major changes to this version includes support for floating-point
numbers and the separation of 0 and null.  This version of GRASS
generates DIFFERENT grass format files due to the floating and null support.
</ul>

<p>
<b>Current Status</b><br>
As of December 1997, we have released GRASS 4.2 to the public.
GRASS 5 has been released under GPL license in Oktober 1999 and already
undergone several beta releases towards GRASS 5.0stable.

<p>
<b>The Future of GRASS</b><br>
Our main goal is to keep GRASS alive and prospering and available to the user
community.  We hope that the continued interest in GRASS will result in its
further development and enhancement.
