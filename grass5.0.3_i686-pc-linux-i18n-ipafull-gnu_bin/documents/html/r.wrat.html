<H2>Introduction</H2>
     The Water Resource Assessment Tool is a collection of
programs run within the GRASS GIS. These programs are an aid
in understanding the nature of runoff in a study area based
on information typically available for a GIS. The programs
analyze the terrain to define drainage direction and areas,
simulate runoff and peak runoff and model nonpoint source
pollution and map contaminant source areas and contaminant
pathways. This users guide outlines the typical analytical
sequence, describes input data requirements and possible
output. Some suggestion for interpreting output are
included. It is assumed the user is familiar with the basics
of GRASS.<p>
 
<H2>Input</H2>
     Map layers required: digital elevation model, land
cover, soil maps of hydrologic soil group, soil texture, and
erodiblity factor (K factor). Optional maps describe best
managment practices for sediment, nitrogen phosphorous and
chemical oxygen demand (COD).  <p>
 
<H2>Typical Analysis</H2>
     Three interrelated areas of analysis are available:
terrain analysis, hydrology and pollution (see figure X1).
Because these areas are not distinct, analysis should
proceed in a logical order since some portions build on
previous results. Terrain analysis and runoff generation
must proceed routing peak discharge, which in turn must
proceed contaminant routing. The following steps provide a
natural sequence of analysis through all of the tools.
However, a great deal of valuable information may be gained
executing only a portion of the available programs. This is
a tool kit, not a prescription for studying every area.<p>

<H2>Defining the study area</H2>
     GRASS looks at the world through a rectangular
"window". The window should be set to include the entire
area of interest with several cells to spare in all
directions. Because of difficulty interpreting terrain at
the edge of the window, the analysis moves in from the
window edge. The extra area is particularly important if the 
top of a watershed of interest is not marked by a steep
decline into the adjacent watershed.<p>
 
    Routing routines assume that the entire watershed is
within the current window. This is not always true or even
practical. For instance, an analysis along the side of a
long river will provide valuable information about local
contributions to the larger resource. However, calculations
in the long river itself can not take into account upstream
effects outside the current window and are thus invalid. Yet
those local contributions may be of considerable interest.
Great care must be taken interpreting results of watersheds
only partially contained within the operating window.<p>
 
     Cell resolution, the size of each cell, should be set
as large as is appropriate for your purposes. In no case
should the resolution be smaller than the spatial resolution
of your best input layer. Doubling the cell length and width
will cut computation times by 3/4s!  The east-west
resolution need not match the north-south resolution.
However, large deviations from square cells will distort
some of the neighbor concepts used by some algorithms to
"feel their way" across the terrain.<p>
 
     Once the analysis is begun, the same window, including
cell resolution, must be maintained throughout the project. 
The interface program tries to insure this. Changing the
boundaries invalidates the drainage accumulation maps.
Changing the cell resolution can have disastrous effects on
the drainage direction map, such as creating dead end and
circular drainages. The idealized elevation model will lose
its "ideal" character if resampled. If the window must be
changed, start the analysis from the beginning.<p>
 
     Some of the output maps may be resampled to a smaller
window or different cell size after the analysis is
finished. Contaminant source area maps are produced in units
of mass per unit area and may be resampled. This may be
useful for presentation of results or incorporation within
another GIS analysis.<p>
 
<H2>Temporal scale</H2>
     Hydrologic simulations are based on single storms,
presumably one day events. Actual or design storms may be
employed.<p>
 
<H2>Terrain analysis</H2>
     The actual analysis may begin using the digital
elevation model to produce an idealized elevation model. 
Real data has, for a number of reasons, sections which are
difficult to drain. The idealized elevation model has no
cells which can not drain to the edge of the window. This
assumes complete surface drainage is possible. This
condition is never completely true and in some regions, such
as those with karst topography, so far from the case as to
invalidate the peak discharge and contaminant routing
results.  <p>
 
     The idealized elevation model is used to determine the
direction in which each cell will drain. This is done by
searching the edge of the window for the lowest point and
draining the watershed that leads there.  Then the next
lowest outlet is found and its watershed drained, and so on
until the entire area is drained.  <p>
 
     The drainage direction map is used to produce a
drainage accumulation map. The values in a drainage
accumulation map are the total number of cells including
that cell, which drain through that cell. If multiplied by
the area of a cell, the drainage accumulation map will yield
the area of the watershed above and including each cell.<p>
 
<H2>Hydrology</H2>
     Two programs contribute to the hydrology section:
runoff and peak discharge. The runoff section is based on
the Soil Conservation Services Curve number method (Soil
Conservation Service, USDA, 1971).  Curve numbers, from 0 to
100, describe the potential for runoff. Curve numbers are
inferred from the land cover map and the map of hydrologic
soil groups. A depth of precipitation for a design storm or
a rainfall map is required to produce a runoff map.<p>
 
     To this point the terrain analysis and the hydrology
could progress independently. From this point on the
distinctions between terrain analysis, hydrology and
pollution, as separate lines of analysis begin to fade.
Actually pollution analysis will always be dependent to some
extent on hydrology but that will be dealt with in a later
section. Peak discharge combines the results of the terrain
analysis and runoff sections.<p>
 
     Peak discharge, the volume of water passing out of a
cell per unit time, is calculated with an empirical
relationship developed by Smith and Williams (1980) and
employed in CREAMS and AGNPS. Watershed characteristics are
interpreted from several all of the results from the terrain
analysis. The resulting map of peak discharge, significant
by itself, is also used in the routing of contaminants.<p>
 
<H2>Pollution</H2>
     Contaminant sources are mapped as the contaminant
originating per unit area.  Sediment, nitrogen, phosphorous
and COD may be modeled. The algorithms used to predict
contaminant mobilization depend on the landcover of the cell
involved. The universal soil loss equation and adaptations
from AGNPS and CREAMS are employed for rural, agricultural
and open lands. An algorithm from SWMM is adopted for urban
areas. Land cover, soil texture and erodibility factors,
rainfall, runoff and peak discharge maps are the required
inputs for this section.  <p>
 
     The final part of the analysis routes contaminants. It
requires the results of the preceding sections. Sediment,
nitrogen and phosphorous nutrients and COD may be modeled.
The routing is done as a mass balance accounting for imports
of contaminants into a cell, contaminants originating within
the cell, losses to infiltration and deposition and exports
to the next cell. Figure X2 is a schematic representation.<p>

<p>
 
<H2>Some practical considerations:</H2>
     GRASS only stores integers, assuming values less then
one to be equal to zero. Therefore small units of measure
have been employed. Rainfall and runoff are described in
hundredths of inches, while quantities of sediment are in
kilograms with nutrients in grams. Flows are measured in
cubic feet per second. The mixing of english and metric
units employs those units in common usage in the U.S.  Maps
may be converted to any appropriate set of units using
"<a href=r.mapcalc.html>r.mapcalc</a>" to multiply the map by the appropriate conversion
factor.<p>
 
<H2>Preparing map layers</H2>
     GRASS associates numeric values with cells as their
attributes. Sometimes these numbers have real meanings, as
in an elevation model in which the cell's value is its
elevation. Some are more arbitrary codes representing
qualitative categories, such as landcover. The following
tables provide guides to units and codes used in the water
resource assessment tools. The GRASS tool "r.reclass" allows
speedy recoding of map layers to these codes.<p>
 
<H2>Input layers and data</H2>
 
<H2>Elevation</H2>
     Values in the digital elevation model represent the
altitude above mean sea level expressed in meters. <p>
 
<H2>Rainfall</H2>
     Rainfall maps should be rainfall for a single day,
measured in hundredths of an inch. Thus a one and a quarter
inch rainfall would be represented as 125. The GRASS command
"s.surf.idw" can be used to interpolate a rainfall map between
observation stations, however, s.surf.idw does not understand
the effects of terrain on rainfall and will make significant
mistakes in hilly country and for thunderstorms passing
through a widely scattered set of observation points. A
design storm may be preferable for assessment purposes.<p> 
<H2>Soil, texture </H2>
     Values are a code for the dominant texture.
<pre>
     1 = clay soils
     2 = silt soils
     3 = sandy soils
     4 = peat
     5 = water
</pre><p>
 
<H2>Soil, hydrologic soil group</H2>
     Hydrologic soil group is primarily dependent on the
soil texture. However depth to bed rock and depth to water
table may strongly influence a soil's classification. <p>

<pre>
     1 = hydrologic soil group A
     2 = hydrologic soil group B
     3 = hydrologic soil group C
     4 = hydrologic soil group D
     5 = water
</pre>
<p>
 
<H2>Soil, erodibility K factor</H2>
     K factors are a decimal value greater then zero and
typically less then .5. Formally they represent the soil
loss rate per unit of per erosion index unit for a specified
test plot. (Agriculture Handbook Number 537 "Predicting
Rainfall Erosion Losses", USDA 1978) Information about local
soils should be available from your local Soil Conservation
Service office. Because GRASS uses only integer values,
multiply K factors by 100. Thus a K factor of .37 would be
coded as 37. Use a code of 100 for water.<p>
 
<H2>Landcover</H2>
The landcover map must be coded so the water resource
assessment tools can recognize the landcovers indicated. 
The following table illustrates the 15 landcover category
codes expected.  When attempting to make the best fit of
available data to this encoding scheme, remember to think of
the areas both in terms of their ability to slow runoff and
their contributions to water quality.  Some creative lies
may be useful for special purposes.  For instance, a
development built to the performance standard that peak
discharge is not to exceed a field in good condition could
be coded as an old field for hydrologic analysis and built
up for pollution analysis.    <p>

<pre>
   1 = corn
   2 = rye
   3 = oats
   4 = soybeans
   5 = hay
   6 = grass
   7 = old field (grass)
   8 = old field (shrub)
   9 = pasture
   10 = forest
   11 = wetlands
   12 = fens
   13 = water
   14 = built up
   15 = barren
</pre>
 
<H2>Output Map layers</H2>
     Many maps can be produced with the water resource
assessment tools. The following sections outline how these
maps are prepared, the units of measure and codes employed
along with some notes as to how they should and should not
be used. More complete information is available in the model
documentation. The source code is also provided and contains
a great deal of internal documentation. Output maps are
presented in the approximate order in which they would be
produced. <p>
 
     The idealized elevation file is a digital elevation
file. Cell values represent elevation in meters.  This
elevation model will differ from the input DEM provided by
the user, in that depressions in the data are filled in so
that water landing anywhere on the idealized surface can
flow to the edge. Although useful for analyzing terrain, and
employed for slope measurements, the idealized elevation
model is probably further removed from reality then the
original data upon which it is based. The idealized
elevation data may not be resampled to a different cell
resolution and retain its desired "idealized"
characteristics.<p>
 
<h2>Drainage Direction</H2>
    Cells in the drainage direction map are coded to
indicate the neighboring cell into which they drain. The
eight nearest neighbors are represented by the integers 1
through 8 as depicted in figure X3.<p>

<pre>
                            4 3 2
                            5   1
                            6 7 8
 
                            figure X3.
</pre> 
 
     Drainage direction is similar to aspect. However they
are not exactly the same thing.  In an aspect map, the cells
at the bottom of a V shaped valley may face each other
without draining into each other. This map is produced by
searching the border of the window for the lowest cell and
draining all cells in that drainage. The algorithm moves up
through the drainage one unit of elevation at a time until
all adjacent cells of that elevation are drained, trying to
assign the most direct drainage direction. Then the next
lowest undrained border cell is found and that watershed is
drained until the entire map is drained. The routine
sometimes has difficulty at the top of watersheds if the
next valley does not clearly drop away.<p>
 
<H2>Drainage Accumulation</H2>
     Values in the drainage accumulation map represent the
number of cells, including the cell with the value, that
drain through the cell. Thus the minimum drainage
accumulation is one, while the maximum is the number of
cells in the largest watershed in the study area. The
drainage accumulation map is used to find the watershed area
for each cell in the study area and to guide a search up the
watershed to find the length of the longest stream. The
drainage accumulation map can be used to define the stream
networks by reclassifying the cells below a minimum
accumulated drainage to zero. The remainder represents the
streams. Drainage accumulation is drainage area represented
in cells. Multiplying a drainage accumulation by the area of
a cell yields the drainage area above that cell.<p>
 
<H2>Runoff</H2>
     The values in the runoff map represent the depth of
water expected to run off that cell, from the input
rainfall, based on the soil and landcover maps specified.
Values could range between zero and the amount of rain that
fell on that cell.  Runoff, like rainfall, is measured in
hundredths of inches.  A value of 75 represents .75 inchs of
runoff. Runoff values can be multiplied by the area of each
cell to give a volume of runoff. However, care should be
taken when converting units because cell sizes in GRASS are
defined in meters. Upgradient values in the runoff map are
summed during the peak discharge calculations and used in
the contaminant source area and routing calculations.<p>
 
<H2>Peak Discharge</H2>
     Peak discharge is the maximum rate at which water
passes through a cell measured in cubic feet per second.
These estimates are based on an empirical relationship which
describes the entire upstream portion of the watershed. If
the entire upstream portion of the watershed is not within
the current window, the model assumes the upstream edge is
the top of the watershed. This is  wrong and estimates of
peak discharge in streams which enter the window are
meaningless as are routings of contaminants based on peak
discharge. The calculations are retained so that local
contributions from side streams and slopes may be modeled. 
These local effects may be of substantial importance to
those involved in the local area regardless of distant
conditions.<p>
 
<H2>Contaminant Source Areas</H2>
     Sediment, nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients and COD can
be simulated. The algorithms used to predict contaminant
mobilization are dependent on the contaminant and the
landcover class. In non urban areas sediment production is
based on the universal soil loss equation. Nitrogen and
phosphorous are modeled both in solution and associated with
sediment in rural areas and only as a function of sediment
in urban areas. COD is assumed to be soluble and is
calculated by loading factors.<p>
 
     Sediment loadings are expressed as kilograms per
hectare. Nutrients and COD loadings are expressed as grams
per hectare.  <p>
 
     These loadings are a function of the rainfall, the
soil, slope and landcover. They do not represent the natural
scatter found in natural events. Results may be used as a
relative indicator of contaminant generation. As such these
maps may highlight those areas in a watershed that would
benefit most from conservation efforts. Subtracting two
source area maps generated for different scenarios would
help locate the areas of greatest change.<p>
 
<H2>Routing of Contaminants</H2>
     Contaminants are routed down stream assuming total
conservation unless a best management practice map for the
particular contaminant is used. If a best management
practice map is used contaminants flux across a BMP is
reduced by the percentage indicated.<p>
 
     The output maps indicate the totak mass of contaminant
passing through a cell. These maps can be used as indicators
of the contaminants delivered to any point down stream.
Similar analysis for varying land cover regimes could be
subtracted with "<a href=r.mapcalc.html>r.mapcalc</a>" to find areas of greatest
positive and negative change resulting from the changes in
scenarios. Again these numbers represent relative
indicators.<p> 
 
<H2>Interface Program</H2>
     The Water resopurces assessment tool is run through an
interface program invoked from the grass environment at any
GRASS prompt by typing wrat. Work is organized in projects
which should represent the investigation of a geographic
area. The user interface is a series of menus which guide
the user through the program. A project file is created
which keeps track of the options used and input and output
map names. The project file also creates a database window
based on the active window at the time a project is started.
The active window is returned to this active window for
subsequent work sessions on the project.<p>
 
<H2>First Menu</H2>
At this menu the user can:<p>

     1 start a new project<br>
     2 start a project based on an existing project<br>
     3 work on an existing project<br>
     4 remove project files<br>
     5 exit <p>
 
The user is prompted for needed information such as the name
of the project to work on with the option of listing project
files if needeed.  Once a project is selected the secon menu
is offered. The User may do:<p>
 
     1 Terrain Analysis<br>
     2 Runoff Analysis<br>
     3 Contaminant Analysis<br>
     4 return to main menu<p>

Choices 1, 2 or 3 lead to menus for each of those analysis.<p>

In the Terrain Analysis the options are:<p>

     1 Create an idealized elevation model<br>
     2 Create a drainage direction map<br>
     3 Create a drainage accumulation map<br>
     4 Create a slope map<br>
     5 Return to the previous menu<p>

In each case except option 5 the user is prompted for needed
information. where appropriate the likely choices are
supplied if not insisted upon. The drainage direction map
must be based on the idealized elevation map. The drainage
accumulation map needs a drainage direction map which should
be the output map from option 2. In this way the user is
guided along.<p>
 
In the <b>runoff analysis section</b> there are only three options:<p>

     1 Create a runoff map<br>
     2 Simulate peak discharge<br>
     3 Return to the previous menu<p>

In this section the options are not as straight forward and
the user is coached along.  The user must provide the names
of several input maps and can obtain a listing by entering
list instead of a map name where requested. The user must
also choose between a design storm and rainfall map. The
most difficult information requested of the user is the
anticeedent moisture condition. This is a number between 1
and 3 inclusivly which describes the amount of moisture
already in the soil which effects the amount of rain which
can be absorbed during the current storm. 1 represents
extreemly dry conditions and 3 extreemley wet conditions.
The concept comes from the Soil Conservation Service curve
number method of predicting runoff. The basic guidance from
the SCS is offered with the request and a value of 2 neither
wet or dry is the default. Peak discharge is quite sensative
to thee anticeedent moisture condition so some care should
be taken here. <p>
 
The <b>contaminant section</b> has only three options as well:<p>

     1 Model Contaminant source areas<br>
     2 Rout contaminants through the watershed<br>
     3 Return to the previous menu<p>

When modeling contaminant source areas the user may model
just sediment or sediment and any combination of nitrogen,
phosphorpus and COD. Because nutrients are associated with
sediment sediment predictions are required for nutrient
modeling. Most input for this section is straight forward
except the number of days since the last significant rain.
The  amount of dirt available to wash off of urban areas
accumulates between rainstorms. Rain storms wash urban areas
clean. a default of 7 days is suggested because this puts
urban and rural areas on roughly even footings for
comparison. To complicate the issue street sweeping also
removes contaminants from road ways and so if the study area
has a regular streeet cla\eaning program that should be
reflected by entering fewer dry days. Several minor rain
storms, especially short hard rains will accomplish the same
cleaning as a long large rain.  SWMM assumes that a half
inch of rain removes half of the available dirt and the next
half inch removes half of what is left an so on. A worst
case for urban areas is a rain ater an extended dry period.
However the goal is to compare watersheds or source areas. 
Agriculturlal areas contribute the most poultion with an
anticeedent moisture condition of 3 since that is when the
most runoff and erosion takes place.<p>
 
 
<H2>Summary</H2>
     The tools presented here run within the GRASS GIS. A
flow chart of input and analysis (figure X1) can be used as
a guide for the order of analysis. The system of units and
means for encoding qualitative information are supplied for
both input and output map layers. Careful preparation of
input maps is strongly encouraged since this effort will
likely save time and trouble later in the analysis. <p>
 
     The ultimate utility of analyses performed with these
water resource assessment tools is dependent on the
interpretation of the user. Always keep in mind that these
results are based on empirical relationships which represent
expectations over a long term average. For this reason
numerical results should be used only for comparison of
areas and scenarios. Employing the entire set of tools from
the tool kit may be inappropriate, and or redundant
information.<p>
 
You can't hurt the model by running it! So feel free to
experiment!
