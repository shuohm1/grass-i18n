<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
This report describes the use and operation of the program <I>v.plant</I>, used with 
the GRASS GIS system.  The report contains (i) a discussion of the problem which 
motivated the development of the program, (ii) a description of the method used, 
(iii) the manual page describing the usage of the program,  (iv) a listing of the source-code.

<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P></B><I>Map projections
<P></I>Projections are representations of information defined on curved surfaces 
(usually spheroids) in two-dimensional space.  This allows the description of the 
location information in cartesian or other plane coordinate systems.  Particular 
projections are defined by precise mathematical relations, which allows conversion 
of maps from between projections to be achieved using straightforward mathematical
 operations [1].  

<P><I>Projecting line segments
<P></I>When converted from one map projection to another, straight-lines become 
curves.  Thus, a line segment which can be described by four parameters only (eg 
the coordinates of the end points) in one projection becomes an arc which needs 
more parameters in other projections.  In GIS systems which describe arcs as a 
sequence of line segments, this means that intermediate points between the ends 
of the segment are used.  The easiest method of projecting a line accurately is 
to include intermediate points in the description in the source projection, so 
that all these points are included in the target map.  

<P><I>Context within the GRASS GIS
<P></I>Vector maps (lines and arcs) in the GRASS GIS are represented by a relatively 
straightforward format.  This is exemplified in the ascii version of vector files, 
as produced by <I><a href=v.out.ascii.html>v.out.ascii</a></I> [2] and described 
in the programmer's manual [3].  Individual vector segments are described by
 a sequence of coordinate pairs, with the number of coordinated pairs for the 
segment recorded in a brief header for each segment.  The program <I>v.prune</I> 
[4] is provided to remove points which are considered redundant through being too 
close together within a segment.  <I><a href=v.prune.html>v.plant</a></I> has 
been designed as the complement of this, to insert extra points at a specified 
spacing along straight-line segments.  

<P><B> Design of v.plant
<P></B><I>v.plant</I> has been implemented as a Bourne shell script.  The basic
 procedure is as follows:
<P>1.  Write out the existing map in the <I>dig_ascii</I> format;  
<P>2.  Use an included <I>awk</I> script to process each vector segment in turn, 
moving from point to point along the segment.  If a span between two adjacent points
 is greater than the specified threshold (in map units) extra points are inserted collinearly.
<P>3.  The modified <I>dig_ascii</I> file is re-imported, overwriting the original file.  
<P>Because the original <I>dig</I> file is overwritten, all the support files are
 preserved.  Since the vector segments remain in the same sequence, and all the 
original points remain in the modified map, including the end-points of each 
segment, all topology, attributes, etc are maintained.  

<P>The usage is exemplified in the attached manual page.  The source code is also
 attached, which may be examined for a detailed understanding of the method.  

<H2>TODO</H2>
A command-line version of <I>v.plant</I> would be highly desirable.
