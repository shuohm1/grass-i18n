<H2>NAME</H2>
<b>r.out.ppm</b> - converts a GRASS raster file to a PPM image file
at the pixel resolution of the CURRENTLY DEFINED REGION.
<P>

<H2>Usage:</H2>
 <b>r.out.ppm</b> [-qG] <b>input=</b>name <b>output=</b>name

<h2>Flags:</H2>
  -q   Run quietly<p>
  -G   Output greyscale instead of color<p>

<H2>Parameters:</H2>
   input   Raster file to be converted.<p>
  output   Name for new PPM file. (use out=- for stdout)<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;          default: &lt;rasterfilename&gt;.ppm<p>

<p>
This program converts a GRASS raster file to a PPM image file
at the pixel resolution of the CURRENTLY DEFINED REGION. 
e.g., to get the resolution of the raster map, do:<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;	g.region rast=[mapname]<p>

before running r.out.ppm.<p>

The PPM file created is 24bit color, rawbits storage by default.
Using -G, you may force r.out.ppm to use 8bit greyscale instead.
The greyscale conversion uses the NTSC conversion:<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Y = .30*Red + .59*Green + .11*Blue

<p>
One pixel is written for each cell value, so if ew_res and ns_res
differ, the aspect ratio of the resulting image will be off.
<p>
<H2>NOTE</H2>
A few ppm file comments are written - the name of the GRASS
raster file, resolution, etc.  Although these are perfectly legal,
I've found one PD image utility that chokes on them, so if you need 
a commentless ppm file, use out=- &gt; outfile.ppm. (When sending 
output to stdout, no comments are written.)<p>

<H2>TODO</H2>
 Allow combination of 3 grass files to represent R, G, B components  of ppm file?
