<H2>NAME</H2>

<EM><b>monitorcap</b></EM>  - Description of device driver database file format.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The 
<EM><A HREF="d.mon.html">d.mon</A></EM> 
command and all graphics commands
access a device driver database stored in the file 
<KBD>$GISBASE/etc/monitorcap</KBD>.
This file contains a line for each graphics monitor on the system.
Each line contains 6 fields separated by colons:

<DL>
<DT>name

<DD>the name by which the user identifies the driver

<DT>program 

<DD>the full pathname of the executable driver or a
pathname relative to $GISBASE

<DT>description 

<DD>A short 4 or 5 word description of the driver.

<DT>fifos 

<DD>full pathnames to the input and output fifos over which
the driver communicates with the libraries

<DT>tty 

<DD>the name of the tty from which the driver must be
started, or empty if there is no such restriction

<DT>msg 

<DD>a message to print to the user if an attempt is made to
start the driver from the wrong tty.

</DL>

<H2>EXAMPLE</H2>

The following is an example of a single monitor system.  The driver may
be started from any terminal and uses 
<KBD>/dev/fifo.a</KBD> and <KBD>/dev/fifo.b</KBD> for
communication with application programs:


<P>

<KBD>x:driver/X:graphics monitor:/dev/fifo.a \ <BR>
/dev/fifo.b::any terminal</KBD>


<P>

This example has 2 monitors on the system, using the same device driver.
Note that each has a different
<EM>name</EM>
field and uses a different pair of fifos.
Also, each must be started on a specific terminal:


<P>

<KBD>
1:driver/X:monitor 1:/dev/fifo.1a \
<BR> /dev/fifo.1b:/dev/tty8:tty8
<BR>
2:driver/X:monitor 2:/dev/fifo.2a \
<BR> /dev/fifo.2b:/dev/tty10:tty10
</KBD>

<H2>NOTES</H2>

Each line in this file must refer to a valid driver.
No comment lines are supported.  Also, no blank lines are allowed.
