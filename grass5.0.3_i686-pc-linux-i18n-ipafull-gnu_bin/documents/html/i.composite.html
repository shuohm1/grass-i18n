<H2>NAME</H2>

<EM><b>i.composite</b></EM>  -
An 
<A HREF="../imagery.html">imagery</A> 
function that creates a color composite image
from three imagery band files specified by the user.

<BR>

<EM>(GRASS Image Processing Program)</EM>

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>i.composite</B>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>i.composite</EM>

creates a color composite image from three band files
specified by the user.  The user specifies the bands to be
used by assigning a red, blue, and/or green color to each
band.  The resulting image is a raster map layer of raw
spectral data composed of the three bands chosen by the
user.  The color composite can then be displayed, painted,
or manipulated as would any raster map layer in GRASS.

<P>

The first prompt asks the user for the
<A HREF="i.group.html">imagery</A> group whose files are
to be used.


<P>

The following menu is then displayed:


<PRE>
Please indicate which files to use for red, green, and blue
colors.  You may leave any color out.  You may specify more
than one color per file.  However, each color may only be
specified once.  For example, to get a full color image,
specify r,g,b for 3 different files.  To get a grey scale
image, specify rgb for a single file.

                     b__    spot.1
                     g__    spot.2
                     r__    spot.3
                     ___    spotclass
                     ___    spotreject

    AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT &lt;ESC&gt; TO CONTINUE
                  (OR &lt;Ctrl-C&gt; TO CANCEL)
</PRE>


The user is then allowed to check the choice of bands:


<PRE>
               Colors assigned as follows:

                 RED:     spot.3@mapsetname
                 GREEN:   spot.2@mapsetname
                 BLUE:    spot.1@mapsetname

                     Look ok? (y/n) [y]

               How many color levels (number of colors = levels^3)? 10
</PRE>

If the number of color levels is set to 10, the color table that is created
has 1000 colors (10 saturation levels (or shades) per primary color (blue,
green, red)).  The number of colors that can be displayed at one time on a
color graphics monitor will depend on the graphics monitor being used. Note
that GRASS currently becomes very slow in displaying maps with more than
8000 colors (color level: 20). So 10 to 15 color levels are recommended.

<P>

The user is then asked to name the composite image raster map layer.
The percentage completed is echoed to the screen and <EM><A HREF="r.support.html">r.support</A></EM> files
are created automatically.

<H2>NOTES</H2>

The user should always check the geographic region settings
before running most 
<A HREF="../imagery.html">imagery</A> commands.  

It is very easy for the boundaries of the geographic region
to be completely off the image.  Before running
<EM>i.composite</EM>, or other

<A HREF="../imagery.html">imagery</A> commands,
the user should probably set the geographic region
to match that of the raster map layers to be read.
This can be accomplished using option 4 of the
<EM><A HREF="g.region.html">g.region</A></EM>
command.


<P>

This program is interactive and requires no command line arguments.
