<H2>NAME</H2>

<EM><b>r.infer</b></EM>  - Outputs a raster map layer whose category values
represent the application of user-specified criteria (rules statements)
to other raster map layers' category values.

<BR>

<EM>(GRASS Raster Program)</EM>

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>r.infer</B>

<BR>

<B>r.infer help</B>

<BR>

<B>r.infer </B>[<B>-vt</B>] <B>rulesfile=</B><EM>name</EM>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>r.infer</EM> is an inference engine which applies a set
of user-specified rules to named raster map layers.  A new
raster map layer named <EM>infer</EM> is created as output,
whose category values reflect the ability of each cell in
the named input layers to satisfy the named conditions.


<P>

<EM>r.infer</EM> commands (conditions and consequences) are
typed into a file by the user using a system editor like
<EM>vi</EM>, and then input to <EM>r.infer</EM> as the
<EM>rulesfile</EM> named on the command line.  The results
are used to generate a new raster map layer named
<EM>infer</EM> in the user's current mapset.  This program
performs analyses similar to
<EM><A HREF="r.combine.html">r.combine</A></EM>,
but uses a (possibly) more pleasing syntax and approach.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

The program will be run non-interactively if the user
specifies the name of a rules file and any desired flags on
the command line, using the form:

<DL>
<DD>
<B>r.infer </B>[<B>-vt</B>] <B>rulesfile=</B><EM>name</EM>
</DL>

where <EM>name</EM> is the name of an ASCII file containing valid input
rules to <EM>r.infer</EM>, and the (optional) flags
<EM>-v</EM> and <EM>-t</EM> have the meanings described in the OPTIONS section,
below.


<P>

Alternately, the user can simply type <B>r.infer</B> on the
command line, without program arguments.  In this case, the
user will be prompted for the needed parameter value and
flag settings using the standard GRASS 
<A HREF="parser.html">parser</A> interface.

<H3>Flags:</H3>

<DL>


<DT><B>-t</B> 

<DD>Allows the user to run <EM>r.infer</EM> in
<EM>test</EM> mode.  The user is questioned about the truth
of each condition named in the file.  <EM>r.infer</EM> then
outputs the value that would be placed in the new layer
<EM>infer</EM> for a cell meeting conditions specified by
the user.  When no sets of conditions stated in the input
file are satisfied (based upon the user's answers), cell
values of zero are output.  Test mode is used to test the
accuracy of the user's logic.  Users are encouraged to run
<EM>r.infer</EM> in test mode prior to actually creating
map layers.

<DT><B>-v</B> 

<DD>Makes <EM>r.infer</EM> run <EM>verbosely</EM>, giving
information about each cell as it is analyzed according to
the statement conditions.

</DL>

<H3>Parameters:</H3>

<DL>

<DT><B>rulesfile=</B><EM>name</EM> 

<DD>Allows the user to input rules to <EM>r.infer</EM> from
an ASCII file, rather than from standard input.  This
rulesfile must exist in the user's current working
directory or be given by its full pathname.  File rules
statements take the same form as those given on the command
line.  Examples of valid rules statements are given in the
sections below.

</DL>

<H2>COMMANDS AND STATEMENTS</H2>

The following commands are available in 
<EM>r.infer:</EM>

<PRE>
COMMANDS AND STATEMENTS
The following commands are available in r.infer:
 Command   |  Aliases  |   Followed By       |       Such As
-----------+-----------+---------------------+----------------------
IFMAP      | ANDIFMAP  | cellmap cat#        | geology 2
           | ANDMAP    |                     |
-----------+-----------+---------------------+----------------------
IFNOTMAP   | ANDNOTMAP | cellmap cat#        | geology 2
-----------+-----------+---------------------+----------------------
THENMAPHYP |           | cat# [statement]    | 3 nice vacation spot
-----------+-----------+---------------------+----------------------
THEN       |           | statement           | No sandstone
           |           | condition           |
-----------+-----------+---------------------+----------------------
IF         | AND       | predefined          | No sandstone
	   | ANDIF     | statement condition |

</PRE>

These five commands may be used to formulate statements
with functions ranging from a simple reclassification to a
more complex expert system type application.  Statements
are composed of one or more <B>conditions</B> followed by
one or more <B>hypotheses</B> and/or <B>conclusions</B>.
The use of aliases is provided to allow for the use of a
command which has an English meaning consistent with the
logic at that point.

<P>

Following is a description of each of the five commands.
The map layers used in the examples are in the Spearfish
sample data base.


<P>
<DT>
<B>IFMAP</B> Map condition
<P>
<DD>Map conditions are questions to each cell about the presence of
specified map layer category values.  <EM>r.infer</EM> questions each cell
in the named map layer (here, <EM>geology</EM>) about its contents
(i.e., category value).
Cells which satisfy the named condition(s) stated by IFMAP
(i.e., here, those cells which contain <EM>geology</EM> map layer category
values 4 or 5) will be assigned the subsequently-stated map conclusion or
hypothesis (category), in the new map layer <EM>infer</EM>.
Cells which fail to satisfy named map condition(s) will
continue to move down through the user's <EM>rulesfile</EM> (searching
for conditions it is able to satisfy) if any additional
conclusions/hypotheses are stated in the file, or will be assigned
category zero in the new map layer <EM>infer</EM> (if no additional
conclusions/hypotheses are possible in this <EM>rulesfile</EM>).


<P>

example: <B> IFMAP geology 4 5</B>

<P>
</DT>

<DT>
<B>IFNOTMAP</B> Map condition
<P>
<DD>Like IFMAP, but instead questions each cell about the <EM>absence</EM>
of specified map layer categories.  Cells which meet the IFNOTMAP
conditions (i.e., below, those cells which do NOT include owner
map layer category value 2) will be assigned the named conclusion\hypothesis,
in the new map layer <EM>infer</EM>.
<P>
example: <B>IFNOTMAP owner 2</B>
<P>
</DT>

<B>THENMAPHYP</B> Map conclusion
<P>
<DD>Assigns each cell a specified category value in the new map
layer <EM>infer</EM> based on the cell's ability or failure
to meet conditions named above this THENMAPHYP statement in
the <EM>rulesfile</EM>.  The user should note that although
the user can specify a uniquely-named <EM>rulesfile</EM>,
<EM>r.infer</EM> always directs its output to a file named
<EM>infer</EM> in the current mapset (overwriting whatever
is currently in this file).  Therefore, if the user wishes
to save this file for future use, this file should be
renamed before the user next runs <EM>r.infer</EM> (e.g.,
using the GRASS command 
<EM><A HREF="g.rename.html">g.rename</A></EM>).
<P>
It is important to realize that <EM>r.infer</EM> runs
through the conditions stated in the named
<EM>rulesfile</EM> one cell at a time, moving from the top
of the raster input file to the bottom of the raster input
file.  As soon as the cell currently being examined by
<EM>r.infer</EM> satisfies a set of conditions, it is
assigned a category value in the new map layer
<EM>infer</EM>.  <EM>r.infer</EM> does NOT check to see if
that same cell satisfies other conditions named further
down in the input file, too.  Instead, it moves on to the
next cell, and begins anew with the conditions named at the
top of the input file.  Essentially, this means that
conclusions made higher-up in the input file have
precedence over conditions named further down in the input
file.
<P>
example:<BR> 

<B> IFMAP density 1

<BR>

THENMAPHYP 1 no trees</B>

<P>

In the above example, all cells having a category value of
<EM>1</EM> (non-forest) in the map layer <EM>density</EM>,
are assigned a category value of <EM>1</EM> in the
resultant map layer <EM>infer</EM>.  The trailing text "no
trees" is entered into the category support file for
category 1 in the new map layer <EM>infer</EM>.

<P>
</DT>

<DT>
<B>THEN</B> Statement hypothesis
<P>
<DD>At the conclusion of one or several condition statements,
instead of making a map conclusion as with THENMAPHYP,
the conditions are used to create a hypothesis.  This may
then be referenced in later statements using the IF command.
The trailing text at the end of the THEN statement is used
as the means with which to reference the hypothesis.
An example follows the description of IF below.

<P>
</DT>

<DT>
<B>IF</B> Statement condition.
<P>
<DD>States a condition based on an hypothesis that was
created by a previous THEN statement.  IF may be
used only after a THEN has set up the group of statements
that are to be referenced later.

<P>

example: 
<P>
<B>IFMAP elevation.255 170-255

<BR>

ANDIFMAP density 3 4

<BR>

THEN high elevation with trees

<BR>

!

<BR>

IF high elevation with trees

<BR>

ANDIFMAP owner 2

<BR>

THENMAPHYP 1 this is the place</B>

<P>

The above example queries each cell for the presence of
<EM>both</EM> elevations greater than 1580 meters (i.e.,
for <EM>elevation.255</EM> category values 170-255) and a
medium to high density of trees (i.e., density category
values 3 4).  All areas (i.e., cells) that satisfy these
criteria are assigned to the hypothesis "high elevation
with trees." The "!" simply tells <EM>r.infer</EM> to
ignore whatever appears on that line (a comment statement),
and is used here for readability.


<P>

The IF statement then references cells having "high
elevation with trees" (i.e., those cells that satisfied
both of the above conditions named by the IFMAP and
ANDIFMAP statements).  If a cell <EM>both</EM> has "high
elevations with trees" and <EM>owner</EM> map layer
category 2 (areas owned by the Forest Service), it is
assigned by the THENMAPHYP statement to category 1 in the
new map layer <EM>infer</EM>.  The trailing text "this is
the place" is automatically entered into the category
support file for the new map <EM>infer</EM>.  Cells failing
to meet all of the conditions stated in this input file
will be assigned category 0 in the new map layer
<EM>infer</EM>.

Mr. Hageman, in the spring of 1986, submitted an inference
engine to the UNIX network.  Mr. Cox reworked the code
submitting an new version shortly thereafter.  It is this
code that forms the guts of <EM>r.infer</EM>.
