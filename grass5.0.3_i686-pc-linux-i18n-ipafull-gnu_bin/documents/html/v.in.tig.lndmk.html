<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

This program creates a GRASS site or vector map of Census "Landmark" features
in the current mapset (UTM or Lat-Long locations only) with labelled
points, areas or lines constructed from the TIGER file records.  Each
point or area Landmark is a record in the Type 7 TIGER/Line file for
a county.
<P>
The user may select the Landmark Features to include in the new map
by specifying CFCC's (Census Feature Classification Code), or by specifying
text string(s) to match with the Landmark Feature Name field.
[Many Landmark records do not have an entry in the Feature Name
field, so use the string matching selection with care.]
<P>
Point Landmarks are generated only from information in the Type 7 file.
Area Landmarks, which often comprise several individually labelled
polygons, are generated from data in TIGER file Types 7, 8, I, P, 1 and 2
(in order of use).
<P>
When making "line" maps, this program functions as a selection front end
to the <EM>
<A HREF="v.in.tig.basic.html">v.in.tig.basic</A>
</EM> program; see that programs documentation for the
information on how these line maps will be labelled.
<P>
TIGER/Line files from multiple counties should not be mixed or
concatenated when using this program.
<P>
The program should function well independent of the termination 
character(s) at the end of each line in the input files.  &lt;LF&gt;,
&lt;CR&gt;, neither, one, or both are acceptable.  Different distribution 
media apparently have different record delimiting characters.

<H2>THE COMMAND MODE OF OPERATION</H2>

Starting <EM>v.in.tig.lndmk</EM> with the <EM>-s</EM> flag invokes the command
mode of operation.  Commands are expected from <EM>stdin</EM>, that is, the
a terminal or a file redirected with '|' or '&lt;'.  When using a terminal
for input, the prompt lists the available commands thus:
<P>
<B>.p(oints) .a(reas) .l(ines) .c(ode)list</B>

<BR>

<B>.s(trings) .m(atch)both .e(nd) .ex(it) &gt;&gt;</B>

<P>

<B>.strings [output_file]</B>
<DT>
<DD>       1 to 10 lines of 30 chars to match with Landmark names;
<DD>       use '!' as first character to require exact case match;

<P>
<B>"The details of the dot commands"</B>
<P>
Note:  Always use the <B>.strings</B>, <B>.matchboth</B>
and/or <B>.codes</B> commands prior to creating a map
with <B>.points</B>, <B>.areas</B> or <B>.lines</B>.
<P>
<B>.points mapname</B>
begins the process of making a GRASS4.1 site map of point locations.
This site map name takes precedence over the site=name parameter that
may be given on the command line.
<P>
Specification of the CFCC's, if any,
for the features you want included in the map should be done on the
line(s) following <B>.points</B> and should conclude with a line
containing <B>.end</B>, which begins the map generation process.  The
CFCC's should be of the form Dnn (<EM>e.g.</EM>, D00; D10 D85 | D23, H12);
several may be given on one line, separated by any common
separator character.  Requested CFCC's may be abbreviated to D1
(meaning D10 through D19) or just D (meaning D00 through D99).
<P>
If matching text strings are desired (see <EM>.strings\'fR), they must be
specified prior to the </EM><B>.points</B> command.
<P>
<B>.areas mapname</B>
begins the process of making a GRASS4.1 vector map of polygons (areas).
This vector map name takes precedence over the vect=name parameter
that may be given on the command line.
Specification of the CFCC's, if any,
for the features you want included in the map should be done on the
line(s) following <B>.areas</B> and should conclude with a line
containing <B>.end</B>, which begins the map generation process.
<P>
If matching text strings are desired (see <EM>.strings\'fR), they must be
specified prior to the </EM><B>.areas</B> command.
<P>
<B>.lines mapname</B>
begins the process of making a GRASS4.1 vector map of lines.  This 
option uses only the Type 1 and 2 TIGER files.  It searches the Type 1
records for the specified CFCC's and matches any specified text strings
to the Feature Name (FENAME) field in the Type 1 records.
Specification of the CFCC's, if any,
for the features you want included in the map should be done on the
line(s) following <B>.areas</B> and should conclude with a line
containing <B>.end</B>, which begins the map generation process.
<P>
If matching text strings are desired (see <EM>.strings\'fR), they must be
specified prior to the </EM><B>.lines</B> command.
<P>
<B>.codes</B>
searches the Type 7 Landmark file and sends to stdout, or to a file if
one specified, the CFCC and the Classification description of each
CFCC present.  If a 'P' or 'A' is specified, both the point and area
codes present are listed.  'L' lists the CFCC codes contained in the
Type 1 file.  The default type, if no type is specified, is 'P'.
This command is provided as a useful aid to the user.


<P>

<B>.strings</B>
records up to 10 following lines (until ".end") as text strings to 
match to the Landmark Feature Name Field in the Type 7 records (Type 1
for making ".line" maps).  A match is made if any of the specfied 
strings is a <EM>substring</EM> of the Feature Name.  If exact case
matching is required, '!' should be the first character of the
entered text strings.  Example:  The Feature Name "Walter Reed Army
Hospital" would be matched by any of the following strings.
<PRE>
  !Walt
  hosp
  Reed
  army hosp
</PRE>
If the optional filename parameter is given, Type 7 records which match
the specified strings are reported to that file, otherwise they
are reported to stdout.


<P>

<B>.matchboth</B>
is used to specify that a Landmark record (or Type 1 record for ".lines")
must match both one of the specified CFCC's <EM>and</EM> one of
the specified text strings to be selected.  A match to <EM>either</EM>
condition is the default mode, and can be explicitly set or reset by the
optional "no" parameter; <EM>i.e.</EM>, <B>.matchboth no</B>.


<P>

<B>.exit</B>
is used to exit from the program.

<H2>THE INTERACTIVE MODE OF OPERATION</H2>
<P>
The following "VASK" menus will be encountered in using the interactive
mode of this program.  Comments following each menu will help you
decide how to answer the questions and create products.
<P>
       GRASS IMPORT FROM CENSUS LANDMARK FEATURE RECORDS
<P>

STEP 1:  Select Type(s) of features to be extracted
<PRE>
   There are Point and Area (polygon) Landmark feature types.
     in the Landmark (Type 7) Records

   There may also be some Line (vector) Landmark features
     in the Basic Data (Type 1) Records

   Mark one feature type you wish extracted:
                                                                               
                   Point   x
                   Area    _
                   Line    _

   View CFCC Codes for selected type  x

   or  Exit program  _

       AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT &lt;ESC&gt; TO CONTINUE
                     (OR &lt;Ctrl-C&gt; TO CANCEL)
</PRE>

Comments:  This is the "Main Menu."  You must select (by entering 'x')
<B>one</B> of the Point, Area or Line choices.
The viewing of the CFCC codes is optional, but is usually done initially.
<P>
The following screen results from a request to View CFCC Codes after
selecting Point features:
<PRE>
     TIGER Type 7 file &lt;tgr53037.f47&gt;
     examined.  15 unique CFCC codes found in 123 records.

     Mark 'x' to see list on screen  _

     Enter file name (home directory) to save list to file  ______________

     AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT &lt;ESC&gt; TO CONTINUE
                    (OR &lt;Ctrl-C&gt; TO CANCEL)
</PRE>
Comments:  You may request to see the list on the screen, or have the
list sent to a file in your home directory, or both.  If you request
neither, the program returns to the Main Menu.  Both point
and area landmarks are reported if either "Point" or "Area" was
selected on the Main Menu.  If "Line" was requested on the Main Menu,
all the CFCC codes in the Type 1 (Basic Data Record) file will be
tabulated (this can be a useful product for other purposes); remember
that the Type 1 file is large and this processing may take a few
minutes or more.
<P>
The following is typical output of CFCC Codes:
<PRE>
TIGER Type 7 file &lt;tgr53037.f47&gt;
Number of Each Area Landmark CFCC
     6 D00 Landmark Feature, Class Unknown or Not Elsewhere Classified
     3 D10 Military installation
     1 D28 Campground
     1 D31 Hospital
     5 D43 Educational institution
     1 D81 Golf course
     7 D82 Cemetery
    14 D85 State or local park or forest
     7 H00 Water Feature, Class Unknown or Not Elsewhere Classified
     8 H11 Perennial stream
     9 H30 Lake or pond
    32 H31 Perennial lake or pond
     1 H32 Intermittent lake or pond
Total Area Records: 95

Number of Each Point Landmark CFCC
     1 D00 Landmark Feature, Class Unknown or Not Elsewhere Classified
     5 D28 Campground
     1 D31 Hospital
    10 D43 Educational institution
     4 D44 Religious institution
     5 D71 Lookout tower
     1 D81 Golf course
     1 D82 Cemetery
Total Point Records: 28
</PRE>

After reviewing the list of available CFCC Codes, select "Point,
Area or Line" again on the Main Menu and something like the following
two menus will appear.  On the first one, select any number of CFCC
Codes (categories) that you desire to be included in a new map.
<PRE>
	LANDMARK FEATURE CATEGORY SELECTION MENU: POINT LANDMARKS
	D00 _ Landmark Feature, Class Unknown or Not Elsewhere Classified

	D28 x Campground
	D31 _ Hospital
	D43 _ Educational institution
	D44 _ Religious institution
	D71 _ Lookout tower
	D81 _ Golf course
	D82 _ Cemetery

	Done: _  Start over: _

      AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT &lt;ESC&gt; TO CONTINUE
                    (OR &lt;Ctrl-C&gt; TO CANCEL)
</PRE>
Comments:  In this case "Point" was selected on the Main Menu, and the
user has indicated that a GRASS site map of Campgrounds is to be made.
<P>
Now you have the opportunity to enter character strings which will be
matched against the Feature Name field (in the Type 7 record in the
case of "Point" or "Area" maps, and in the Type 1 record for "Line"
maps).
<PRE>
  Step 1C  Enter text(s) to match in finding Landmark Features.
           (Use ! as first char to require exact case match.)

                    _______________________________
                    _______________________________
                    _______________________________

                    _______________________________
                    _______________________________

           Check for any Landmark Records that match your
           text strings before proceeding to next step?  _

           File to save matches to (omit for screen display):
          __________________________________________________

        AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT &lt;ESC&gt; TO CONTINUE
               (OR &lt;Ctrl-C&gt; TO ERASE AND START OVER)
</PRE>
Comments:  See <EM>.strings</EM> discussion in the command line section of
this manual page for examples of what can be entered on the lines.  If
no entries are made then no string matching to the Feature Name field
will be done.


<P>


<H2>BUGS/RESTRICTIONS</H2>

Some area features are included in the Type 7 (Landmark)
file which do not fit the definition given of "Landmark" (CFCC's
beginning with 'D'), as a mechanism to have them included in the
Tiger/Line data.  Many Hydrography area features fall in this category
for some counties.  Also, there may be records in both the Type 1 and
Type 7 files for some Landmark features, such as airports, and to make
a complete airport map for a county both sets must be extracted.


<P>

In the first trials of this program is was discovered that the TIGER/Line
files have several defects in topological completeness when area landmark
polygons are created.  These defects express themselves when 
<A HREF="v.support.html">v.support</A>
 is run
(automatically) to attach labels to the polygons and is unable to attach
one or more label points.  Some editing with 
<A HREF="v.digit.html">v.digit</A>
 should be able to
resolve these problems.


<P>

<B>Caution:</B> 
This program will overwrite an existing vector map of
the same name without warning.  Site_list maps will not be overwritten.


<P>

Since this program opens many TIGER files at once, the set for a county
must reside on a disk or CD-ROM, not tape.  Only file types 1, 2, 7, 8,
I and P are used so only those would have to be copied from tape to disk.


<P>
