<H2>NAME</H2>

<EM><b>i.tape.spot</b></EM>  - An imagery function that extracts
SPOT imagery from half-inch tape.

<BR>

<EM>(GRASS Image Processing Program)</EM>

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>i.tape.spot</B>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>i.tape.spot</EM> is a program that extracts SPOT
imagery from 9-track, half-inch tape.

<P>

This program must be run in a LOCATION_NAME with an x,y coordinate
system (i.e., a coordinate system with projection 0).
For further information regarding 
this LOCATION_NAME type refer to the <EM>imagery</EM> manual entry.


<P>

The first prompt in <EM>i.tape.spot</EM> asks the user for the 
tape device name.  

<DL>
<DD><KBD>Enter tape device name:</KBD>
</DL>

This is sometimes  <KBD>/dev/rmt0</KBD> (for a half-inch
tape having a density of 1600 bpi), but this varies with
each machine.

<P>

The next prompt is:
<P>

<DL>
<DD><KBD>Mount SPOT tape and  hit RETURN --&gt;</KBD>
</DL>

<H2>IMAGE IDENTIFICATION MENU</H2>

The first menu in the program asks the user for information
about the data.


<PRE>
      Please enter the following information

TAPE IDENTIFICATION:                             __

IMAGE DESCRIPTION:                               __

TITLE FOR THE EXTRACTED CELL (RASTER) FILES:     __

AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT &lt;ESC&gt; TO CONTINUE
              (OR &lt;Ctrl-C&gt; TO CANCEL)
</PRE>

This program automatically reads the satellite name, tape
product code, instrument name, interleaving indicator,
spectral mode, preprocessing level and work order number
into the field for TAPE IDENTIFICATION.  The mission, path,
row, scene shift, scene center date and time, orientation,
incidence, azimuth, elevation angle, and absolute
calibration coefficients and offsets are automatically
entered into the field for IMAGE DESCRIPTION.  User can
type in any other messages into the two sections and a
description as the TITLE of raster map layer.  The second
menu is:

<PRE>
                SPOT IMAGE EXTRACT
    Please select region of the image to extract

             start row: 0______(1-3002)
               end row: 0______(1-3002)

             start col: 0______(1-3166)
               end col: 0______(1-3166)


AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT &lt;ESC&gt; TO CONTINUE
              (OR &lt;Ctrl-C&gt; TO CANCEL)
</PRE>

The numbers in parentheses are the total number of rows and
columns on the tape including zeros (filler).  This
information and additional information can also be obtained
by running the program

<EM><A HREF="m.examine.tape.html">m.examine.tape</A></EM>.
<EM><A HREF="m.examine.tape.html">m.examine.tape</A></EM> 

will read any tape and provide the user with the number of
files on a tape, the number of records on a tape, and the
record lengths.  Any subset of the image on the tape may be
extracted.  For a discussion of row and column extraction
see the subheading enTITLEd 
<A HREF="#rcx">ROW AND COLUMN EXTRACTION</A> below.


<P>

The next menu is:

<PRE>
  Please mark an x by the bands you want extracted

                      _____ 1
                      _____ 2
                      _____ 3

AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT &lt;ESC&gt; TO CONTINUE
              (OR &lt;Ctrl-C&gt; TO CANCEL)
</PRE>

SPOT imagery has three bands, but the user may want to extract 
a subset of these bands.  See the subheading in this entry
enTITLEd 
<A HREF="#rcx">ROW AND COLUMN EXTRACTION</A>.


<P>

The user then is asked to enter the prefix/group name for the raster band
files to be created.  This name will precede each band file
extracted into GRASS.  For example, if two bands are extracted 
the following two band files will result:


<P>

<EM>prefixname.1</EM>

<BR>

<EM>prefixname.2</EM>


<P>

The specified <EM>prefixname</EM>
will also automatically become the name for the imagery group 
file being created.  Each image or subset (i.e., each run of <EM>i.tape.spot</EM>)
should be given a unique prefix/group name.


<P>


</PRE>
The extraction process will begin by first skipping a number
of files which are not data or not requested,
advancing to the first band requested, 
forwarding to the requested column, and then reading the data.
After extracting the requested rows and columns from each band, the
program creates support files for the raster band map layer.
The percent completion of the extraction is displayed
on the screen.  Because sometimes SPOT imagery is very large and is  
stored in multiple tape sets, the program is designed to read
image by pausing when the tape need to be changed and inform
the user to mount and load next tape. 
The number of tapes required to store one scene depends on the
number of bytes per inch (bpi) in which the data are stored.


<P>

The extracted band files will be listed as raster map layers
available in the current MAPSET and may be displayed using the GRASS
commands 

<EM><A HREF="d.display.html">d.display</A></EM>, 
<EM><A HREF="d.rast.html">d.rast</A></EM>, or 
<EM><A HREF="i.points.html">i.points</A></EM>.

<A NAME="rcx"><H2>ROW AND COLUMN EXTRACTION</H2></A>

The display options in GRASS allow the user to locate rows
and columns on the digital image.  If enough disk space is
available, one band of an entire image or one band of a
portion of an image known to contain the area of interest,
can be extracted and displayed.  The <EM>measurements</EM>
option in

<EM><A HREF="d.display.html">d.display</A></EM>, or 
<EM><A HREF="d.where.html">d.where</A></EM> 
(following use of <EM><A HREF="d.rast.html">d.rast</A></EM>)

will echo x and y coordinates to the screen.  (These
coordinates will display negative numbers in the
north-south direction, but ignoring the negative sign will
yield the row number.)  See the 

<EM><A HREF="../imagery.html">imagery</A></EM> manual
entry for further explanation.


<P>

Each scene of a SPOT image contains filler on both the left
and right sides of the quad.  The user may want to identify
the row and column numbers in order to exclude the filler.
This filler will otherwise be extracted with the image and
take up unnecessary disk space.


<P>

If a photograph of the digital image is available, the rows
and columns to be extracted can be determined from it by
associating inches with the total number of known rows and
columns in the scene.  For example, if the total length of
the photograph is 12 inches, the total number of rows on
the tape is 2000, and the northwest corner of the area of
interest begins 2 inches from the top of the photo, then:


<DL>
<DD>12" / 2000 rows = 2" / x rows
<DD>x = 333.333
</DL>

The northwest corner of the area of interest starts at row
333.  The starting row, ending row, starting column, and
ending column can be calculated in this manner.

<H2>NOTES</H2>

After extracting an image from tape the geographic region
definition in the x,y coordinate LOCATION_NAME will be set
based upon the extracted rows and columns from the tape.
The relationship between the image rows and columns and the
coordinates of the geographic region is discussed in the

<EM><A HREF="../imagery.html">imagery</A></EM> 
format manual entry.

<P>

This program is interactive and requires no command line
arguments.
