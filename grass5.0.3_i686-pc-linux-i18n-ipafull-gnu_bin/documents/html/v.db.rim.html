<b><i>v.db.rim</i></b> - RIM data base management/query interface for GRASS vector

<BR>


<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>v.db.rim</B>
<EM>data_base</EM>
-- to run the command version
<B>v.db.rim</B>
-- to run the interactive version (see SECTION TWO)

<H2>OVERVIEW</H2>

<B>v.db.rim</B>
allows you to create, manage and query information about labeled lines
and areas from a number of different vector maps in a batch mode or
interactively.  Operations are done
on a data base through a command language defined below or an
interactive set of menus described in SECTION TWO.


<P>

This program, like
<B>s.db.rim</B>,
is actually a marriage of the GRASS environment
and the programmer's interface library of the relational data base
management program RIM distributed publically by the University of
Washington Academic Computing Services.  Your system must have a
FORTRAN 77 compiler to use this program.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The vector data bases are stored in a subdirectory named 'rim/vect' in the
user's current mapset.  Data bases in other mapsets, selectable through
the GRASS
<B>g.mapsets</B>
command, can be accessed for 'read-only' retrieval of
records.  Each mapset may have many data bases.  Each data base within
a mapset must have a different name; user supplied names are limited to
seven (7) characters in order to maintain compatibility with the
standard version of RIM.  As with other GRASS commands, mapsets are
searched in the mapset SEARCH_PATH order when a data base needs to be
opened.


<P>

Each vector data base is composed of multi-field records (rows or tuples,
in DBMS jargon).  Each field and its position in the record form is
defined via input to the .make command when a data base is originally
defined.  It is possible to add new fields or change the length of
existing fields after data has been loaded, however this is not
straightforward; deleting of fields is also possible, but requires even
more experience and knowledge.  The user needs to carefully design the
data base fields and form (layout) and check the operation with a
few pieces of test data before loading data for a large number of records.


<P>

One significant difference between
<B>v.db.rim</B>
and
<B>s.db.rim</B>
is that v.db.rim needs access to the original vector maps that data were
imported from to successfully complete some commands.  To keep track of which
records were imported from which vector maps a new "table" has been added
that keeps information about the reference vector maps.  This
table is called "Referencemaps" in the RIM data base.  The v.db.rim
commands .read_vect, .map and .maps allow the user to view and update this
table.  The .vector_map command, which creates a new GRASS binary
vector file, requires that the reference vector maps for the database
be accessible.  If a reference map is not accessible, any vectors
represented by the data
base records that were generated from that vector map will not be
transferred to a new vector map.  Reference vector maps may be in any
mapset in the current SEARCH_PATH.

<H2>COMMANDS</H2>

[Note: For each of the "dot commands", i.e., .make, described below
there is a menu choice to selected when running the
interactive version.  The interactive menus are described in the SECTION
TWO of this document.  Some display capabilities exist in the
interactive version which are not directly implemented in the command
version.]


<P>

The commands are given alphabetically here for easy reference. The .make
command is required to create a data base.
Abbreviations down to the
string shown in ( ) are accepted; this is primarily for those giving
<B>v.db.rim</B>
commands from a terminal, but abbreviations may also be used in batch files.


<P>

Each command is introduced with an input record (line) which starts
with a period and is followed by one of the words shown below; for some
commands the command line also contains one or more required or
optional parameters.  Additional or optional input instructions/data
for a command is supplied on successive lines; a .end line is needed by
some commands to signify the end of these lines.
<P>
<B>"Alphabetical Command Summary"</B>
<P>
<DT>"<EM>!command</EM>" 

<DD>This is the only
<B>v.db.rim</B>
command not starting with a period.
"command" is a single shell command line (no more than 80 characters)
which is executed by a
"G_system()" call (see GRASS gis library).  Many UNIX utilities
(e.g., vi, ls, print) and most GRASS commands (e.g., d.rast, d.sites,
g.list, g.region, r.mask) may be executed.
It is permitted, and often useful, to change "region" and "MASK" within
<B>v.db.rim.</B>
Multiple commands may be separated
by ";" in the standard UNIX way.  Note that a "!cd directory; ls" will
change to the specified directory and list files, but the effective
working directory for
<B>v.db.rim</B>
will not be changed when the command terminates.

<DT>"<EM>.add (.a)</EM>"

<DD>Add a new vector record (row) to the open data base.  Each line
following contains a field name followed by spaces and/or tabs then the
value or character string to store for that field.  Field information
lines end with .end.  Some fields may be absent and fields may appear
in any order.  The input of data is checked for one required
field (sequence number), for field length for text type fields, and for
duplicate sequence numbers.  If split text fields are used in the data base
layout (see .make), text data for each split field must be added as a
separate line.  If there are any problems, the record will not be
stored and a message will be output.  This format makes it relatively
easy to import data from most other DBMS.  The ".print -a" command, see
below, outputs data in this list format.
<P>
<PRE>
Example:
 .add
 seq_num   204
 north     4690673.30
 east      601410.00
 map_num   1
 vect_type L
 reference Jones (1987)
 .end
</PRE>
<DT>"<EM>.backup (.b) file_name</EM>"

<DD>The .backup command is used to dump the entire data base from the
RIM binary files to a text file format (see UNLOAD in the RIM User's
Manual).  The file_name can be a relative path name or full path name.
The file will contain the data base definition, screen layout
information, and tabular data.  This text file is transportable to RIM
or
<B>v.db.rim</B>
running on any other computer; it may also be reloaded to recreate the
<B>v.db.rim</B>
data base.  A message will be output if there is any problem writing
the .backup file.  Backup can only be done on data bases in the user's
current mapset.
<P>
To reload your data base from the backup file (normally not necessary):
<P>
<PRE>
GRASS 4&gt; cd $LOCATION/rim/vect     #right directory
GRASS 4&gt; rm db_name.rimdb*         #remove data base
GRASS 4&gt; rim                       #run RIM manually
RIM&gt; input "path/file"             #RIM rebuilds data base from data
                                    written by .backup
RIM&gt; exit
</PRE>
<DT>"<EM>.change (.c) [ -l ]</EM>"

<DD>Without the "-l" flag,
each line following .change is in the same format as for the .add
command.  The sequence number field is required and the sequence number must
match an existing site in the data base.  Only those fields for which lines
are provided are changed in the record.  After the .end the changed
record is stored, if all is ok, otherwise a message is output.
<P>
If the "-l" flag (for "list") is given, the sequence number field
is omitted and the specified field values are changed in all records
currently selected by .find and/or .query.
<P>

<DT>"<EM>.delete (.d)</EM>"

<DD>This command is used to delete data records.  Deletion of records is
permanent.  Each line following the command should contain only
a sequence number that you want to delete, with a .end
line being last.
<P>
A backup of the data base or copies of the
data base files are the ways to protect your valuable data.
The following command sequence will delete all the records
currently on v.db.rim's query list (the result of the last .query
or .find command), after asking for approval.
<P>
<PRE>
 .delete
 .end
 </PRE>
<DT>"<EM>.end (.e)</EM>"

<DD>Ends multi-line input for several other commands.
<P>

<DT>"<EM>.exit (.ex)</EM>"

<DD>Use .exit to end operation of
<B>v.db.rim</B>
cleanly.  In general, do
not use CTRL-C to exit unless absolutely necessary.  When .exit is
encountered in a batch file, input will revert back to the previous
file, or the terminal, if any, which called the batch file.
<P>

<DT>"<EM>.find (.f) [-m | -w] [-a | -d]</EM>"

<DD>The .find command is used to find the record(s) whose location (label point)
is closest to a given point (the target).  The target can be defined
in one of several ways. The found records are stored on an
internal query list for output by other commands; however, see note 2,
below.  Records are stored on the query list in order
of proximity to the target location.
The optional .find command line parameter specifies the current MASK
(-m), if any, or the current region (-w), as a filter on the retrieved
records; see notes 3 and 4, below. The append (-a) or delete (-d)
options allow the "found" records to be added or deleted from the
currently selected ones.  When adding, duplicates will be discarded.
<P>
The single required line following the .find line gives the program
the necessary target information.  The following examples show the
possibilities.
<P>
<PRE>
find&gt; 602793.90 4379010.00
</PRE>
will find the one record nearest these coordinates and store
it, append it or delete it on the internal query list.
<PRE>
find&gt; 619840 4599000 10
</PRE>
will find the 10 records (or fewer, if there are not that
many) closest to the given location.
<PRE>
find&gt; record 132 10
</PRE>
will find the 10 records closest to the location (label point) for
record 132
in the data base (including record 132).  If record 132 does not exist,
no action is taken.
<PRE>
find&gt; distance from 472910.06 5732001.0 5000
</PRE>
will find all records within 5000 (meters in UTM coordinates)
of the target location.
<PRE>
find&gt; distance from record 16 -2500
</PRE>
will find all records greater than 2500 (meters) from the
location of record 16.
<P>
<B>Notes for .find:</B>
<P>
1.  All records found by each .find are stored on the query list
in order of proximity to the target location (sorted by distance from target).
<P>
2.  The number of records found is automatically printed to the active
output device/file.
<P>
3.  If mask is specified, the effective region is automatically set to
the current region (because the GRASS mask is only defined for the
current region).
<P>
4.  Region and mask filtering uses the current resolution for the
region to test if a point falls within a cell.
<P>
5.  In the last two examples the string "distance from" must be exactly
matched.  Also, the word "record" must be exactly matched.
<P>
6.  If the "distance from" radius is given as a negative value, points
outside the target circle are selected; whereas, if a positive value is
given, points inside the circle are selected.
<P>
7.  The current region may be changed with !g.region or !d.zoom prior
to doing a .find, and the mask may be set or removed with a variety of
GRASS commands.
<P>
8.  The "find&gt;" prompt is given only when input is from a terminal.
<P>
9.  The "distance" between the target location and a record for a line
or an area is actually the distance between the target location and
the representative point that is stored in the data base.  This can
lead to unexpected results when the representative point (label point)
for a line or area is not near the "center" of the feature.
<P>
<DT>"<EM>.help (.h)</EM>"

<DD>Prints a help screen to the output device or file.  Useful to have
when using
<B>v.db.rim</B>
from a terminal, or when writing a script file of commands.
<P>
<DT>"<EM>.input (.i) [file]</EM>"
<DD>The lines in the given file are read and processed as commands or
data until an end of file is reached or until a .exit command is
found.  Input files may call other input files, by using this command,
to a nesting depth of eight.
Without a file name stdin is used as the input file.
<P>
<DT>"<EM>.list (.l)</EM>"

<DD>Lists the available data bases in the current mapset search path.
<P>
<DT>"<EM>.make</EM>" 

<DD>Using the .make command you create a new data base in the current
mapset by specifying the following items which define the screen (page)
layout for displaying and printing the records, as well as the
information fields:
<PRE>
1)  The fixed text part of the screen layout.
2)  The positions, types, and lengths of data fields.
</PRE>
<P>
Five fields must always exist in a data base; each
of these field types may only occur once in a data base layout:
<PRE>
1) Type 's'  Sequence number field (a unique integer for each record).
2) Type 'x'  Easting coordinate of the representative point (a double float).
3) Type 'y'  Northing coordinate of the representative point (a double float).
4) Type 'v'  Vector type field (a text field).
5) Type 'm'  Reference Map field (an integer).
</PRE>
The other field types, which may occur in any combination and
order, are:
<PRE>
6) type 'i'  An integer field.
7) type 'f'  A double precision float field.
             (always 2 decimal places used for output)
8) type 't'  A text field.
</PRE>

Each of the fields can be positioned anywhere within the screen
layout, which has a limit of 19 lines by 80 columns.  A maximum of 70
fields may be defined within this space.  A field is specified in the
screen layout by a tilde (~), a field type character, a field name and
enough trailing tildes to fill out the desired field length.
<P>
Each line following the .make command is taken to define a line of
the screen layout until a .end is reached.  If a mistake is made on any
of the input lines, the .make will fail.  The .make information may be
prepared in advance as a text file (this facilitates fixing mistakes)
and the .input command can be used to read in this file.  An example
text file for a data base screen layout follows, with some explanatory
notes and restrictions.
<PRE>

 .end
</PRE>
Notes:
<P>
1)  Any text not preceded by a tilde (~) character is taken to be
part of the constant or fixed text portion of the form.
<P>
2)  A field definition begins with a tilde (~) character
immediately followed by a single character which indicates the data
type of the field (s,x,y,v,m,i,f or t).  Immediately following the data
type character is the field name of 1 to 16 characters.  Field names
can be composed of any characters from the following set: [A-Z,a-z,_,0-9];
the RIM program and library do not distinguish upper and lower case in
field names, so you should avoid making names which differ only in
case.  Field names may not begin with a numeral [0-9].  The rest of
the field length is padded with tilde (~) characters to the length desired.
<P>
3)  The minimum field width is three characters; e.g., "~tA".  Be
sure field widths for all fields are wide enough for the values and
strings you expect to store there; e.g., UTM northings require at least
11 spaces.
<P>
4)  For text fields it is possible to continue a field across more
than one line.  This is done by appending a .1 to the field name
forming first portion of this "split field", a .2 for the second
portion, etc.  This text field splitting affects how information is
organized for input and output; the composite text string is
concatenated (unused portions of fields are retained as spaces) and
treated as a unit for storage and queries to the data base.
<P>

<DT>"<EM>.map (.m) [ map_id map_name ] | [ -d map_id ]</EM>"

<DD>Without arguments this command
outputs a list of all the reference vector maps that are stored in
the reference maps table.  If a map number (map_id) and a vector map
name (map_name) are given the vector
map is found and added to the reference maps table in
the data base.  If the map number (id_num) is already in that table an
error is issued and no action is taken.
<P>
Finally, to delete a map from
the reference maps table, use the '-d' option followed by the map
number (map_id).  The map information for the given map number will be
displayed and the user will be asked to confirm the deletion with
a 'y'.  Enter a 'n' (for no) if you do not want to delete that reference
map.
<P>
Remember, that if you delete a reference map for which there are still
records in the data base, you cannot make a new vector map
(using the .vector_map command) that includes those records unless you
put that number and vector map name back in the reference map table.
<P>
<DT>"<EM>.output (.o) [file or | process]</EM>"

<DD>Causes all output (except some error messages) from
<B>v.db.rim</B>,
including that from the .print command, to go
to the named path/file (may be a full or relative path name),
or to be used as standard input by the process
(a pipe).  If no parameter is given, output returns to stdout,
usually the user's terminal.  An example of the pipe usage would be
<PRE>
	.output | grep "easting" | wc -l &gt; /tmp/my_count
</PRE>
A pipe is closed whenever the .output command is given again, or
on a .exit command.
<P>
<DT>"<EM>.pack (.pa)</EM>"

<DD>This should be used when numerous data records have been deleted or
changed to recover disk space in the RIM binary data base files.  It
works by doing a .backup to a temporary file; moving the data base
files to new names (*.bakdb*); running RIM to rebuild the data base;
and, if the rebuilt data base can be opened and read, the temporary
files are deleted.  The user is informed if this process fails.  Packing
can only be done on an open data base located in the user's current mapset.
<P>
<DT>"<EM>.print (.p) [-a | -l] </EM>"

<DD>This command outputs the full record for the records currently
stored on the internal query list (result of last .query or .find).
Without the flag, the screen layout format is used.  With the -l flag,
for list format, the field name followed
by the contents are output one field per line.
The -a flag also outputs in the list format but with a .add line
and a .end line surrounding each record printed; data files in this form
can be read with .input, thus they form one kind of backup mechanism and
can be used to transfer data (not the data base layout) from one GRASS
system to another.  The destination
for the output is set by a previous .output command (default is stdout).
<P>
<DT>"<EM>.query (.q) [-m | -w] [-a | -d]</EM>"

<DD>The .query command is used to retrieve records via an SQL-like
request to RIM, including a user specified "where clause." All
fields for each record meeting the selection criteria are retrieved.
<P>
The optional .query command line parameters cause records whose
representative points are not in the region (-w) and/or mask (-m)
to be rejected, so these conditions need not be tested in the "where
clause".  See .find for a full explanation of the command line options.
<P>
After the query command line, any number of lines (each no more than
80 characters) may be entered to define the SQL "where" clause.
A .end line is required to finish the request and begin data retrieval.
See examples below.
<P>
The "distance from" clause may also be used as an additional
selection criteria exactly as described in the examples
and notes for .find.  It must be entered as a separate line
to the query prompt.
<P>
The retrieved records may be printed at time of retrieval, rather than
after the completion of the query command by including a .print (.p)
line with the same options for print format as in the .print command
(see above); e.g. .p -a to output in the "list add" format.  The .print
clause must be entered as a separate line to the query prompt.  This
feature is most useful when working with very large data bases where
retreval time is significant.  See example 2 below.
<P>
Example 1
<PRE>
query&gt; where density &lt; 20 and (date = "10/14/89"
query&gt; or county eq "San Marcos")
query&gt; .end
</PRE>
Example 2
<PRE>
query&gt; where east &lt;600000 and name like "*Jones*"
query&gt; distance from record 12 3000
query&gt; .print -a
query&gt; .end
</PRE>
Example 3
<PRE>
query&gt;.end
</PRE>

The where and distance from clauses are each optional.  If both are
omitted, only the mask and region on the .query command line restrict
the search; if mask and region are also omitted, all records will be
retrieved (Example 3).  When querying for records the where clause is
processed first, the current region and mask tested (if requested),
then the distance from clause is applied; a record must pass all tests to
be put on the internal query list (or appended or deleted)
for output by other commands.
<P>
Notes:  (Also see Notes for .find)
<P>
1.  The retrieved records are stored on the internal query list in the
order returned from the data base by RIM, not necessarily in sequence
number order or the order the data was loaded.  A "distance from" clause
results in a final sorting by proximity to the target.
<P>
2.  See the RIM User's Manual and the s.db.rim manual page
for additional information on the "where clause" in the "select"
command, especially the quotes required for matching character
string (text) fields, and the allowed comparison operators.  (These
are also described in SECTION TWO of this manual entry.)
<P>
3.  In the example where clauses above, "density", "date", "county",
east", and "name" are field names (column names in RIM) defined when
the user initially makes the data base.
<P>
4.  Each .query or .find resets the internal query list, unless the append
or delete options are used.  In no case is a record allowed to be
duplicated on the query list.
<P>
<DT>"<EM>.read_vect (.re) vector_map_name [attribute_field [text_field]]</EM>"

<DD>This command will read an existing GRASS vector map and create a
data base record for each labelled area, line, and point.
The sequence number field will automatically be generated starting
from one greater than the highest current number in the database.
If the optional <EM>attribute_field</EM> is provided it must be an
integer field and it will be filled with the area, line, or point
attribute label.  If the optional <EM>text_field</EM> is provided and a
category description file (a dig_cats file) exists for the vector map, the
category descriptions will be copied into the given text field.
<P>
Once the records have been loaded by .read_vect, use .change
to add data to other fields for those records.
<P>
Note:  Only
<B>labeled</B>
areas, lines and points are imported from the vector map.
<P>
<DT>"<EM>.remove</EM>" 

<DD>This command, which requires a "y" as confirmation on the next
line, entirely removes the three binary files which constitute your RIM
data base.  Use with care.  Backup files must be removed individually
by the user, if desired.
<P>
<DT>"<EM>.show (.sh)</EM>"

<DD>This command is used to output the screen or page layout as defined
for the current data base.  It serves as documentation of the data base
definition and as a reminder for field names, types and lengths.  By
using an editor to surround the output of .show with .make and .end
lines, it can be used to reload the data base definition with .input.
<P>
<DT>"<EM>.site_list (.si) file_name [field_name]</EM>"

<DD>This command writes the location coordinates (representative point)
and a comment to the specified file in the site_list directory in the
current mapset for each record currently selected.  If
the site file exists, the sites are appended to the current list, otherwise,
a new site list file is created.  A "field name" may be optionally
specified; if so, the contents of that field (retrieved from the
appropriate site record) are inserted as the comment (following a '#')
in the site list; the record number is used if no field name is
given.  Such site lists may be used as input to s.db.rim.
<P>
A comment line is inserted in the site_list file with the current
date and time and the name of the data base producing the site
locations.  The format used for each site is:
<PRE>
easting|northing|#number or comment
</PRE>


<DT>"<EM>.tables (.t)</EM>"

<DD>Prints the table structure of the currently opened RIM data base.
This is the same output generated by a "list *" command when running
RIM manually.  The information for the table named "data" is useful for
review of the user's field definitions, and the table named
"Referencemaps" contains the reference map information.
The information in the two other tables is for internal use by
<B>v.db.rim.</B>
<P>
<DT>"<EM>.vector_map (.v) file_name [attribute_field [text_field]]</EM>"

<DD>This command creates a new binary vector map by copying the vectors
associated with each record on the query list from the reference
vector maps into the new vector map.
<P>
If the optional <EM>attribute_field</EM> parameter is provided, the areas
and lines in the new vector map will be labeled from the given
integer (i, m or s type) field value for each record.  You may supply
a fixed integer value (such as 1, 908, -7, etc.) instead of a field name;
each line written to the new map will be given this constant attribute/label.
<P>
If the optional <EM>text_field</EM> is provided, it will be used to build a
category description file (dig_cats file) for the vector map.  Instead
of a field name, a constant text string of up to 100 characters may be
given, if enclosed in single or double quotes; this string is used as
the category description for each line written to the new vector file.
<P>
The header of the new binary vector file will contain the current date
and indicate that <B>v.db.rim</B> was used to create the vector map.
<P>
The topology information (the dig_plus file) is not automatically
built for the new vector map and the user must run
<B>support.vect</B>
to do so before
<B>v.digit</B>
can be used to edit the vector map or some other programs can be used.
The vector map can immediately be
displayed, from within <B>v.db.rim</B> by issuing the following command
(assuming you have a graphics monitor selected):

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
<B>v.db.rim</B>
The interactive version
allows you to create, manage and query information about vectors
across the landscape
on a data base through a series of menus (VASK screens) explained below.
<H2>THE MAIN MENU</H2>
Below is the main menu.
Option 1 is the default.  Note the status line at the top of the menu,
and the fact that 8 records have been selected by the last find or
query operation (between items 2 and 3).  Note, also, that CTRL-C can
be used to exit from this menu (and most other menus in the program)
back to the GRASS prompt.  The specifics of each menu choice are
described below.  Except for 6, and mouse options in 3 and 4, each
choice has a direct counterpart in the command version.
<PRE>

      v.db.rim                MAIN  MENU                 Version 1.4

            (OR &lt;Ctrl-C&gt; TO EXIT THIS PROGRAM)


</PRE>
1.  Open a data base.  If a data base is already open, it is closed
before the requested one is opened.  Only data bases in the user's
current mapset may be modified; others are opened in read-only mode; this
will be indicated on line 2 of the menu.
<P>
2.  List available data bases.  For each mapset in the current GRASS
mapset search path, the names of the existing vector data bases are listed.
<P>
3.  "Find" records in the data base relative to a specified target location.
This is used to select records based on proximity to the target and,
optionally, records within the current region and, optionally, records
falling in active cells within the current GRASS mask.
The label point coordinates are used for these spatial tests.  Two modes of
targeting are provided:  the N records closest to the target, and all
records within (or outside) a circle of specified radius from the target.
The FIND/QUERY TARGET MENU discussed below accepts region/mask/target
specifications from the user.  The selected records are then displayed one
at a time until CTRL-C is entered; then other operations, choices 5-8,
can be done with these records. The line on the menu between 2 and 3 shows
the number of records currently selected by choices 3 or 4.
<P>
4.  "Query" records in the data base using an SQL-like "where clause,"
including specifications for region/mask/target (circle only) as in
3, above; see FIND/QUERY TARGET MENU section below.  The where clause
can test for ranges or matches for numeric data base fields, or matches
on full strings or substrings for text fields.  The selected records are
then displayed one at a time until CTRL-C is entered; then other
operations, choices 5-8, can be done with these records.  This clause is
entered on a QUERY COMMAND MENU described below.
<P>
The where clause may use parentheses ( ) to control the order of
comparisons.  Field names are not case sensitive within where clauses.
The following comparison operators are valid for all types of fields:
<PRE>
          eq   or   =            ne   or   &lt;&gt;
          ge   or  &gt;=            le   or   &lt;=
          gt   or   &gt;            lt   or    &lt;
</PRE>
String comparisons are case sensitive and are done character by
character.  Substrings comparisons may be done with the "like" operator
as in:
<PRE>
          where name like "*Jones*"
</PRE>
Note that the string being tested against the name field for each
record is in quotes (single or double) and that wild card comparisons
can be done in the standard way with '*' and '?' characters.
<P>
Logical comparisons may also be combined with those operators above.
The permitted logical operators are:
<PRE>
          and       or       not
</PRE>
The following complex example should be examined.  The line breaks can
occur between any tokens (words, values, operators), except within
quoted strings.
<PRE>
    where (name like "*Jones*" or name = "Smith")
    and ( ( site &lt; 300 and not (site = 251 or site eq 15) )
    or east &lt; 601000 )
</PRE>
5.  This choice will display the records resulting from the last
find/query one at a time on the terminal.  Use ESC or enter a number
to display another record and CTRL-C to end the display.
<P>
6.  If a graphics monitor is active, the selected vectors
will be displayed.  The user may choose to erase the screen;
display cell, vector, and/or site maps; and/or display the selected vectors
from the data base; these maps are requested through the following
interactive screen.  Just enter ESC to skip this step.  If no data base
vectors are currently selected, that section of the menu will not appear;
but the menu can still be used to display the other types of maps.
<PRE>
               SELECTION MENU FOR ITEMS TO DISPLAY

Enter cell and/or vector map names, if desired

 ______________  Cell file to display
 ______________  Vector file to display in color: _________
 ______________  Site list to display
                 Dpoints with: size=3_ type=box____ color=white____
               _ Display currently selected vectors (enter x)
                 Dvect red______
               _ Erase graphics screen (enter x)
                 Derase  black____

              AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT &lt;ESC&gt; TO CONTINUE
                            (OR &lt;Ctrl-C&gt; TO CANCEL)
</PRE>

7.  This selection results in a screen prompting for the name of the
file to output the selected records to, and for optional formatting
selection.  If the file name is lp, the site records are sent to the
printer.  The optional formatting choices are for export of data in list
and add formats; see the .print description in SECTION ONE of this
manual page for information and examples.
<P>
8.  Using this choice you can create a new GRASS vector map
consisting of the vectors for the currently selected records, and/or
a site list consisting of the
representative points (label points) for the currently selected
records, in your current mapset.  A short menu
prompts for the map names and other information.
<P>
If a vector map name is given you can choose an integer field (i, s, or
m types), or a fixed value, to write as the label value for each vector
in the dig_att file for the new map.
You may also specify a field name (any type), or a fixed text string in
single or double quotes, to write as the category description in the
dig_cats file for the new map.
<P>
If you give a site list name, you can specify the name of a
field (or fixed text string in quotes) to be used for the "#comment" in the
site list (the record number is the default field).
The current date and time, and the names of the
mapset and data base in use are entered as an information line in the
site_list file.  Note that you can create a new site list or append to
an existing site list, or both.
<P>
A variety of cell maps can be produced from a <B>v.db.rim</B>
data base by creating new vector files then using the
<EM><A HREF="v.to.rast.html">v.to.rast</A></EM>
program, and by writing site_lists with different fields as "comments" then
converting the site_lists to cell maps with
<EM><A HREF="s.menu.html">s.menu</A>.</EM>
<P>
9.  Choices 9-12 operate on only a single record and do not use or modify
the internal list of records selected by find/query (choices 3 or 4).
Choice 9 is the way to view a single record, selected by record
number.  After viewing, ESC will allow entry of another site number
and CTRL-C will exit to the main menu.
<P>
10.  Use this selection to add a new record to the data base.  (A new
record is one whose number does not currently exist in the open data
base.)  After making this selection, the data base layout will be
displayed and you should enter the available information appropriate to
each field; the only required entry is the site (record) number field.
If values for numeric fields are not entered, zero values will be stored.
Unused portions of text fields are stored as strings of spaces.
<P>
11.  After making this selection and specifying the record number to
change field information for, the data is entered as for choice 10,
except that the record number cannot be changed.  (The command version
of the program has provision for making bulk changes after a find or
query; see .change.)
<P>
12.  To delete a single record, enter its number when requested.
All records chosen by the last find/query operation may be deleted
by entering "list" in place of the record number.  BE CAREFUL with this,
<EM>deleted records are really gone.</EM>
<P>
13.  This choice starts a new menu with less commonly used functions.
See MANAGEMENT MENU section below.
<P>
14.  The program will prompt you for one-line Shell Commands until
you enter just a &lt;RETURN&gt; to return to the main menu.
<P>
<H2>FIND/QUERY TARGET MENU</H2>
<P>
This is the screen to set up the region/mask/target information for the
find choice (3) and the query choice (4), except that item B is omitted
for choice (4).  If a graphics monitor is not active, the "mouse" item
is omitted from the menu; and, if a mask is not currently set, that line is
omitted.
<P>
The choice to append or delete the selected records will only be given
after a successful find or query has stored some records on the internal
record list.  When appending records, duplicates of those previously
selected will be discorded--they will not be stored a second time.
If neither append nor delete is selected, the find or query will begin
a new internal record list and the previous contents will be lost.
<P>
The choices entered on this example screen will result in all
the records within a 1500 (meters) radius of the target point (to be
chosen with the mouse) being
selected and stored on the internal record list by find or query.
They are sorted and stored in order of proximity to the target.
If a specific record is used as the target, it's representative
point (label point) is the target coordinates, and it is always placed
first in the retrieved list.  If a mouse is chosen to select the
target point, a menu to display reference maps is presented, exactly
as in choice (6), prior to actually activating the mouse.
<PRE>

        QUERY/FIND:  REGION/MASK/TARGET SELECTION MENU
  Data base &lt;arch&gt; (READONLY) in mapset &lt;PERMANENT&gt; open.  25 records.
    Mark requests with 'x' and enter required values.

               Respect current region   x

               Respect current MASK     x
              (forces current region)

A.  Find all sites within (or outside) a circular target   x
             and give the radius (negative for outside)  1500.00_____
                        OR
B.  Find a number of sites nearest a point   _
         and the number of sites requested   ________

    After selecting A or B, complete one(!) of these:
        1. x to select target point with mouse    x
        2. Enter site number for target point     __________
        3. Target coordinates             east    0.00________
                                         north    0.00________

 Append(a) or Delete(d) to the current FIND/QUERY list  _
 Reset to default choices for this menu _

         AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT &lt;ESC&gt; TO CONTINUE
                       (OR &lt;Ctrl-C&gt; TO CANCEL)
</PRE>

<H2>QUERY COMMAND MENU</H2>

The following screen completes the information for a query (choice 4).
It may be left blank if no "where clause" is required.  After a
successful query, the selected records are displayed one at a time by
hiting ESC; CTRL-C will quit the display and return to the main menu
where several choices of operation on the retrieved sites are offered.
The SQL "sort by" clause may also be used after the where clause to
control the order selected records are presented; however, if option
A or B in the TARGET MENU has been selected it causes sorting by
proximity to the target location which will override the order produced
by the "sort by" clause.
<PRE>
        QUERY COMMAND CONSTRUCTION SCREEN
  Data base &lt;wells&gt; in mapset &lt;grant&gt; open.  25 records.
 The SQL select query will use the current region
 and a target clause of 'distance from 596463.15 4919041.88'

where date = 10/16/89 and ppm_Cr gt 10____________________

<H2>MANAGEMENT MENU</H2>

Choice 13 from the main menu presents this menu.  Each item is
discussed below.
<PRE>

    v.db.rim      DATA  BASE  MANAGEMENT  MENU
Data base &lt;fires&gt; in mapset &lt;Yellow&gt; open.  250 records.

  1   Make a New Data Base in Current Mapset
  2   List Available Data Bases
  3   Remove (PERMANENTLY) Data Base from Current Mapset
  4   Recover a Data Base from a RIM ASCII File
  5   Show Screen Layout of Current Data Base
  6   Backup (UNLOAD) Data Base to RIM ASCII Format File
  7   Pack the Current Data Base
  8   Read a vector map into the Current Data Base
  9   Execute a Bourne Shell Command Line

  0   Return to Main Menu

 0_ Your selection

 AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT &lt;ESC&gt; TO CONTINUE
             (OR &lt;Ctrl-C&gt; TO CANCEL)
</PRE>

1.  Use this choice to create a new data base in the current GRASS
mapset.  See section below on MAKE A NEW DATA BASE.
<P>
2.  List available data bases.  Like 2 on main menu.
<P>
3.  Delete an entire data base from the current mapset.  The name of the
data base and additional confirmation of the action are prompted for.
<B>Be careful!</B>
<P>
4.  Choice 6 allows backup of the definition and data parts of a data
base to a transportable text file.  To rebuild (or build
for the first time) a <B>v.db.rim</B>
data base from one of these text files do the following steps:
<PRE>
        # see if the rim directory exists.
     ls $LOCATION/rim/vect
        # if the directory was not found, make it.
     mkdir $LOCATION/rim
     mkdir $LOCATION/rim/vect
        # change directory to it.
     cd $LOCATION/rim/vect
        # have rim build and load the binary data base files.
     rim
     RIM&gt; input '/path/to/your/textfile'
     RIM&gt; exit
</PRE>
The data base is thus created in the current mapset.  Several
<B>v.db.rim</B> commands should be run to verify the integrity
of the newly created data base.
<P>
5.  This merely shows the screen layout of the currently open data base.
It is a useful way to quickly see the layout and review the field names
and types.
<P>
6.  When backing up to a text file, the RIM UNLOAD command is run with
the output directed to a file of the user's choice.  See 4 above.  It is
wise to do this operation after extensive changes or additions of data
records.  The resulting text file can be written to tape for
preservation, or shared with other GRASS systems, if desired.
Data bases may also be backed up by copying the three binary files
which comprise the data base to a different directory with the UNIX
cp command.
<P>
7.  After  deleting and adding a large number of site records, some
"wasted" disk space will be present in the binary data base files.  This
procedure will perform an unload and a reload automatically to recover
this unusable disk space.  If there is any problem reopening the data
base after packing, the user is notified and can recover in various ways
depending on the backups which have been done.
<P>
8.  Data (records) may be loaded into a data base from an existing GRASS
vector map.  This procedure will prompt for the vector map name and then
add a record to the currently open data base for each labeled(!) line
in the vector field.  The user may also enter the name of an integer
field in which to store the label (from the dig_att file) for each
vector, and a text field in which to store the descriptive text
from the dig_cats file for each vector.
The record number, vector type, map number and location coordinate
fields (s,v,m,x and y types) are automatically
loaded for each site record by this procedure; other fields may be later
edited with the "change" function.
<P>
9.  This choice is the same as choice 14 on the main menu.
<P>
<H2>MAKE A NEW DATA BASE</H2>

After entering the name of the new data base you wish to create (7
characters maximum), you then decide how to input the information
required.  This input may be from a text file, or may be entered directly
using the editor of your choice; the former is recommended.
See discussion in .make in SECTION ONE.
<P>

<H2>NOTES</H2>

1.  A "date" type field should be added to future versions.  This
version only allows storing of dates as strings (unless the user codes
them to integers), and thus only string type searches can be made for
dates.
