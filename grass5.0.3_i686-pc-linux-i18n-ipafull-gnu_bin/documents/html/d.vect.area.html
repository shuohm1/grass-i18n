<H2>NAME</H2>
<B><EM>d.area</EM></B> - Draws vector areas to the GRASS display<BR>
<EM>(GRASS Display/Vector Program)</EM>

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>
<B>d.vect.area</B>
[<B>-r</B>] 
<B>map</B><EM>=name</EM> 
[<B>fillcolor</B><EM>=name|R:G:B</EM>]
[<B>linecolor</B><EM>=name|R:G:B</EM>]
[<B>catnum</B><EM>=value[,value,...]</EM>]
[<B>legend</B><EM>=filename|"-"</EM>]


<H3>Flags:</H3>
<DL>
<DT><B>-r</B> 
<DD>Fill all areas with a randomly selected color from a small color palette,
and draw all boundaries in black. The palette is similar to the GRASS named
colors, but replaces white and black with other colors.
</DL>

<H3>Parameters:</H3>

<DL>
<DT><B>map</B>
<DD>Name of existing vector map to be displayed

<DT><B>fillcolor</B>
<DD>Color desired for filling polygons. May be specified as a standard
grass color name, or as an RGB triplet (e.g. 80:198:255).  Fill can
be disabled by specifying a color of "none".
<DD>Default: white

<DT><B>linecolor</B>
<DD>Color desired for drawing area boundaries.  May be specified as a
standard grass color name, or as an RGB triplet (e.g. 127:127:127).
Line drawing can be disabled by specifying a color of "none".
<DD>Default: black

<DT><B>catnum</B>
<DD>List of category numbers to restrict which areas are drawn.  Ignored
if either the <EM>-r</EM> flag or the <EM>legend</EM> options are used.

<DT><B>legend</B>
<DD>Name of a legend file specifying what color to use for 
each category (see below). If "-" is specified, the legend
will be read from standard input.
<DD>Default: none
</DL>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

Use <EM>d.vect.area</EM> to draw labelled areas from a vector map to the GRASS
display.  Using, the "<EM>-r</EM>" flag, the program will cycle through
a small color palette, overriding any <EM>fillcolor</EM> or
<EM>linecolor</EM> argument.  If a <EM>legend</EM> file is specified, it will
be used.  Otherwise, the color used for filling areas is as specified.

<P>

The <EM>fillcolor</EM> argument may be any of the standard named GRASS colors,
or and RGB (red, green, blue) triplet.  An RGB triplet must have the
form <EM>&lt;num&gt;:&lt;num&gt;:&lt;num&gt;</EM> where <EM>num</EM> is
between 0 and 255.  If "none" is specified, no fill will be done.  Specifying
"none" does not make sense for the random color option, since it always draws
lines in black.
<P>

The <EM>linecolor</EM> argument specifies the color to use for drawing
area boundary lines.  It has the same format as <EM>fillcolor</EM>, and
also accepts the "none" color to disable line drawing.

<P>
An optional list of category numbers may be used to restrict which areas are
drawn (only valid with the <EM>fillcolor</EM> and <EM>linecolor</EM> options).

<P>
More control can be had by creating a <EM>legend</EM> file.  At the
time of this writing, GRASS does not have any management functions
for specifying how vectors should be drawn, so this file must be
created by "hand".  The easiest way to create such a file, is
to copy the category file for the vector map, and edit it to
contain color specifications.  The format of the <EM>legend</EM>
file is <EM>category red green blue [red green blue]</EM>,
with one entry per line.  The first RGB color specifies the fill
color, while the optional second one specifies the boundary
line color.
If a category for a map is not included
in this file, it will not be drawn unless there is a special "default"
entry with a category of -1.  Boundary lines are not drawn unless
either a boundary color is specified for the category, or there is
a default boundary color.  Using the keyword "none" for either
<EM>fillcolor</EM> or <EM>linecolor</EM> in conjunction with a legend
will override drawing fill or boundary lines.

<DL>
<DT><B>Example Legend File</B>
<DD>
-1 255 255 255 127 127 127<BR>
1  210 198 168<BR>
5  168 198 220<BR>
</DL>

<P>

In the above, all labelled areas will be drawn in white (255, 255, 255)
with dark gray boundaries (127, 127, 127)
except those labelled as categories 1 or 5.  If the "default" entry
had been omitted, then only areas labelled 1 or 5 would have been drawn.
Since the entries for 1 and 5 don't specify a color for boundary lines,
no boundary lines are drawn.

<P>
One may place comments on any line in the legend file by starting it
with a non-numeric character ('#' is a good choice).  Empty lines
are ignored.

<H2>NOTES</H2>
<P>
It is expected that the legend specification aspect of this module
will change when an infrastructure for managing vector drawing
styles is implemented.
