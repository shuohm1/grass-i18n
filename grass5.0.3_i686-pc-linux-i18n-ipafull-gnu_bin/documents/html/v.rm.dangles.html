<H2>NAME</H2>
<EM><B>v.rm.dangles</B></EM> - Remove lines of specified length 
from GRASS vector file. (GRASS Vector Program)

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>
<B>v.rm.dangles</B><BR>
<B>v.rm.dangles help</B><BR>

[<B>maxlength=</B><EM>value</EM>]

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
<EM>v.rm.dangles</EM> removes lines from a binary
vector file (input) which have a length less than or equal to maxlength.  
The length is computed as sum(sqrt(x^2+y^2)) for the entire 
length of the line in the units of the map. Lines that have 
attached lines at BOTH ends are not removed, regardless of length.
(Note that nodes that have more than 1 line attached show as red
in v.digit. Nodes with a single line show as green.) 
<P>

Specifying maxlength of less than or equal 0 (default is -1)
disables length checking and only lines with attached lines
at both ends are output. Note that the lines at the ends of 
a string of lines will be eliminated because they have 2 lines
attached at one node (endpoint) and only 1 line attached at the
other node. For example, 5 lines attached in a row would have 
the first and last line eliminated leaving 3 lines when 
using maxlength = -1. Running v.rm.dangles maxlength = -1 
again would remove 2 more lines, leaving 1 line in this example.
<P>

See v.build.polylines for building single lines from 
multiple attached lines.
<P>

To remove small segments on the order of the map resolution
(from a raster to vector conversion, for example) consider
specifying maxlength to be slightly greater than sqrt(2) 
times the map resolution (assuming the Easting and Northing 
resolutions are the same).
<P>

The input file is NOT changed. The input file is coppied to
the output file with appropriate lines removed.
<P>

This program is very simple.  It copies header information 
to the new map file but does not copy catagory or attribute
information.
