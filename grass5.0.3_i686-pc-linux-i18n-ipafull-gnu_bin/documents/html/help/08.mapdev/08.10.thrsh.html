      DIGITIZING THRESHOLDS, MAP THRESHOLDS AND SNAPPING THRESHOLDS
    </H2>
  </CENTER>
    <P>The <A HREF="./../../../../documents/html/g.region.html">g.region</A> program is used to set the <A HREF="./../../../../documents/html/help/16.glossary/res.def.html">resolution</A> of data stored in
raster data format.  However, when digitizing vector files in GRASS, and
when converting vector files to other (e.g., raster) data formats, the
data &quot;resolution&quot; is based on the digitizing (or map) threshold and
the node snapping threshold.  These threshold levels are explained
briefly below.  Use the &quot;ESC&quot; key to obtain more detailed explanations
of their use.
