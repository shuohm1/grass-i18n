      CHARACTERISTICS OF DMA'S DTED-2 ELEVATION DATA
    </H2>
  </CENTER>
    <P>A digital elevation data file consists of a sampled array of elevations for
ground positions that are generally at regularly-spaced intervals.
    <P>The Defense Mapping Agency (DMA) produces an elevation product called
Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED).  DTED is available in two levels,
DTED-1 and DTED-2.  The level refers to the resolution of the elevation
data.  The resolution is the amount of space between each sample elevation
point in the data file.  DTED-1 has a resolution of roughly 100 meters,
while DTED-2 has a resolution of roughly 30 meters.  
    <P>Although both the DMA and the USGS distribute DTED data, each distributes
it in a different tape format.  The program you use to extract DTED data
from tape will therefore depend upon your source of the data (DMA or USGS).

    DTED-2 Data Characteristics:
  </CENTER>
    <P>
  <CENTER>
    *  Coverage is limited.  Production has only been done for special
  </CENTER>

  <CENTER>
    projects.  Inquire at the DMA about coverage for your
  </CENTER>

  <CENTER>
    area of interest.
  </CENTER>

  <CENTER>
    *  The data are ordered from south to north in profiles that are
  </CENTER>

  <CENTER>
    ordered from west to east.
  </CENTER>

  <CENTER>
    *  Elevation points along each profile are spaced at intervals of
  </CENTER>

  <CENTER>
    1 arc-second (roughly 30 meters). This provides for a
  </CENTER>

  <CENTER>
    30 meter resolution data file.  The information content
  </CENTER>

  <CENTER>
    is approximately equivalent to the contour information on a
  </CENTER>

  <CENTER>
    1:50,000 scale map.
  </CENTER>

  <CENTER>
    *  Elevations are in meters relative to mean sea level.
