      CHARACTERISTICS OF DMA'S DTED-1 ELEVATION DATA
    </H2>
  </CENTER>
    <P>A digital elevation data file consists of a sampled array of elevations
for ground positions that are generally at regularly-spaced intervals.
The Defense Mapping Agency (DMA) produces an elevation product called
Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED).  DTED is available in two levels,
DTED-1 and DTED-2.  The level refers to the resolution of the elevation
data.  The resolution is the amount of space between each sample elevation
point in the data file.  DTED-1 has a resolution of roughly 100 meters,
while DTED-2 has a resolution of roughly 30 meters.  
    <P>Although Both the DMA and the USGS distribute DTED data, each distributes
it in a different tape format.  The program you use to extract DTED data
from tape will therefore depend upon your source of the data (DMA or USGS).
    <P>
  <CENTER>
    DTED-1 characteristics are given below:
  </CENTER>

  <CENTER>
    The unit of coverage is a 1-degreeX 1-degree block.  This
  </CENTER>

  <CENTER>
    corresponds to the east or west half of a 1:250,000 USGS map
  </CENTER>

  <CENTER>
    sheet.  However, these blocks are referenced by their
  </CENTER>

  <CENTER>
    southwest corner coordinates (Lat., Long.) rather than by
  </CENTER>

  <CENTER>
    the names of the corresponding USGS map sheets.
  </CENTER>
    <P>
  <CENTER>
    * Coverage is available for many regions worldwide, although
  </CENTER>

  <CENTER>
    predominantly for those within the Northern Hemisphere.
  </CENTER>
    <P>
  <CENTER>
    * The data are ordered from south to north in profiles that are
  </CENTER>

  <CENTER>
    ordered from west to east.
  </CENTER>
    <P>
  <CENTER>
    * Elevation points along each profile are spaced at intervals of
  </CENTER>

  <CENTER>
    3 arc-seconds (roughly 100 meters).  This provides for
  </CENTER>

  <CENTER>
    a 100 meter resolution data file.  The information content
  </CENTER>

  <CENTER>
    is approximately equivalent to the contour information on a
  </CENTER>

  <CENTER>
    1:250,000 scale map.
  </CENTER>
    <P>
  <CENTER>
    *  Spacing of the elevation points between each profile varies by
  </CENTER>

  <CENTER>
    latitude.  From 0 degrees N to 50 degrees N, the spacing is
  </CENTER>

  <CENTER>
    3 arc-seconds.  From 50 degrees N to 70 degrees N, the spacing
  </CENTER>

  <CENTER>
    is 6 arc-seconds.  North of 70 degrees N, the spacing is
  </CENTER>

  <CENTER>
    9 arc-seconds.
  </CENTER>
    <P>
  <CENTER>
    * Elevations are stated in meters relative to mean sea level.
