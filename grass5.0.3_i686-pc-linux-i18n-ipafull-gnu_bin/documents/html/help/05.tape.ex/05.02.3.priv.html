      PRIVATE SOURCES OF ELEVATION DATA
    </H2>
  </CENTER>
    <P>Only certain elevation products are now available from the DMA and USGS
(i.e., only 100-meter and 30-meter data, for certain geographic regions).
Fortunately, private companies also produce and distribute elevation data.
Private companies have the flexibility to produce elevation data for
any user-defined geographic area (e.g., only areas within installation
boundaries, half of a USGS quad, etc.), and can use two different data
sources to produce their digital elevation data files.
    <P>For example, if one needed to acquire elevation data for one 1:24,000
quad that was unavailable from the USGS, a private company could produce
the elevation data in roughly three to four months at a resolution of
15 meters.  The cost charged by a private company, which averages
$2000.00-$5000.00 per USGS quad, is significantly higher, however.
    <P>Digital elevation products produced by private companies are generally
referred to as &quot;Digital Terrain Models&quot; (DTM).
    <P>Use the &quot;ESC&quot; key to select one of the topics below for information
on digital terrain models (DTM) produced by private companies:
