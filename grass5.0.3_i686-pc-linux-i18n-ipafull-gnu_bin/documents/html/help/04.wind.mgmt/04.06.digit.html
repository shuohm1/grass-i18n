      DEFINING FRAMES AND REGIONS FOR DIGITIZING
    </H2>
  </CENTER>
    <P>The GRASS <A HREF="./../../../../documents/html/v.digit.html">v.digit</A> program is used to <A HREF="./../../../../documents/html/help/16.glossary/digitize.def.html">digitize</A> data in GRASS <A HREF="./../../../../documents/html/help/16.glossary/vector.def.html">vector</A>
format.  Unlike most other GRASS programs, the &quot;v.digit&quot; program does
NOT use the boundaries and <A HREF="./../../../../documents/html/help/16.glossary/res.def.html">resolution</A> of the user's current
<A HREF="./../../../../documents/html/help/16.glossary/georeg.def.html">geographic region</A>.  Instead, the user establishes map boundaries
(the &quot;digitizing region&quot;) when entering &quot;v.digit&quot;, and modifies the
map's resolution by setting the digitizing &quot;<A HREF="./../../../../documents/html/help/16.glossary/threshold.def.html">threshold</A>&quot; in the 
&quot;v.digit&quot; Customize Menu.
    <P>When the user begins to digitize a file with &quot;v.digit&quot;, the program
asks the user to define the boundaries of the geographic region being
digitized.  Once the edges of this region are established, &quot;v.digit&quot;
will recognize only data digitized by the user within these boundaries.
This region is referred to as the &quot;digitizing region&quot;.
    <P>Users can set different digitizing regions for each map digitized. 
Typically, users might elect to set these boundaries equal to those of
the default region; however, this is up to the user.  The current
geographic region setting stored in the user's &quot;WIND&quot; file does not
affect the user's digitizing session.  Conversely, digitizing region
setting does not affect the user's current geographic region setting.
    <P>Inside &quot;v.digit&quot;, the user can graphically zoom into different areas
within the digitizing region to aid digitizing.  These zoom-in areas
are referred to as &quot;working frames&quot;.  They do not affect which areas
can be digitized, but only affect which areas of a map will be seen on
the graphics monitor.  Establishing working frames in &quot;v.digit&quot; does
NOT alter the user's digitizing region nor the user's current
geographic region settings.
    <P>Note:  The current geographic region settings become important after
all digitizing is done, when the user converts a digitized vector map
to <A HREF="./../../../../documents/html/help/16.glossary/rastdata.def.html">raster</A> format.
    <P>For more information on digitizing maps, select the topic area
&quot;Digitizing and Map Development,&quot; located at the Help System Main
Menu.
