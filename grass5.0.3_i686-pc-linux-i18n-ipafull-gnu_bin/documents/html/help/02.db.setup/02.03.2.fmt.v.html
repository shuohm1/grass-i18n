</P>What Are Vector Data?
    <P>In GRASS vector format, area, linear, and point features are represented
as the series of <A HREF="./../../../../documents/html/help/16.glossary/arc.def.html">arcs</A> forming their perimeters.  An arc (aka, <A HREF="./../../../../documents/html/help/16.glossary/vector.def.html">vector</A>)
is stored as a series of x,y coordinate pairs.  The two end-points of an
arc are called <A HREF="./../../../../documents/html/help/16.glossary/node.def.html">nodes</A>.  Two consecutive x,y pairs define an arc segment
(aka, line segment).
    <P>Arcs, either singly or in combination with other arcs, form higher-level
<A HREF="./../../../../documents/html/help/16.glossary/mapfeat.def.html">map features</A> like linear features (e.g., roads or streams) and area
features (e.g., soil types or timber cutting units).  Arcs that form
linear features are sometimes called <A HREF="./../../../../documents/html/help/16.glossary/line.def.html">lines</A>, and arcs that outline areas
are called <A HREF="./../../../../documents/html/help/16.glossary/area.def.html">area</A> edges or area lines.  Areas are also called <A HREF="./../../../../documents/html/help/16.glossary/polygon.def.html">polygons</A>.
In GRASS vector format, polygons are not stored explictly;  they are
reconstructed by finding the series of arcs that form their perimeters.
    <P>A GRASS vector data file is generally associated with other GRASS
supporting files describing category values, category labels, and file
topology.  Together, these files constitute a vector <A HREF="./../../../../documents/html/help/16.glossary/maplayer.def.html">map layer</A>.  Read
the information under &quot;GRASS Database Directory Structure,&quot; located back
at the menu, if you wish further information on the location and content
of vector data and supporting files.
    <P>Typically, data are <A HREF="./../../../../documents/html/help/16.glossary/digitize.def.html">digitized</A>, imported, and exported in vector format
and are analyzed in their raster format.  Data can be displayed and
output in either format.
