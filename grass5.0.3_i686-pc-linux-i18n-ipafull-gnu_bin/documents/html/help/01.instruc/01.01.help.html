      WELCOME TO THE GRASS ON-LINE HELP SYSTEM
    </H2>
  </CENTER>
    <P>The GRASS On-Line Help System provides information about GRASS and
its many capabilities.  Information is organized under &quot;topic areas&quot;
which categorize GRASS commands by their specific application within
GRASS.  Each area provides you general information about a topic
(i.e., map development).  You then have the option to explore the
topic further by accessing more specific information on the GRASS
commands which correspond to that topic. 
    <P>The Help System also provides users with an on-line glossary of the
most commonly used GIS and GRASS terms and an on-line version of the
GRASS User's Reference Manual.

    <P>Information is linked throughout the Help System, by the use of
<A HREF="./../../../../documents/html/help/01.instruc/01.02.help.html">highlighted keywords</A> or <A HREF="./../../../../documents/html/help/01.instruc/01.02.help.html">text strings</A> within the text.  By using
