</P>    <P>    <P>arc - GRASS <A HREF="./../../../../documents/html/help/16.glossary/vecmaps.def.html">vector maps</A> are stored in an <A HREF="./../../../../documents/html/help/16.glossary/arcnode.def.html">arc-node</A> representation
consisting of non-intersecting curves called arcs.  An arc (a.k.a.,
<A HREF="./../../../../documents/html/help/16.glossary/vector.def.html">vector</A>) is stored as a series of x,y coordinate pairs.  The two
end-points of an arc are called <A HREF="./../../../../documents/html/help/16.glossary/node.def.html">nodes</A>.  Two consecutive x,y pairs
define an arc segment (a.k.a., line segment).  Arcs, either singly
or in combination with other arcs, form higher-level <A HREF="./../../../../documents/html/help/16.glossary/mapfeat.def.html">map features</A>:
line features (e.g., roads or streams) and <A HREF="./../../../../documents/html/help/16.glossary/area.def.html">area</A> features (e.g.,
soil types or timber cutting units).  Areas are also called <A HREF="./../../../../documents/html/help/16.glossary/polygon.def.html">polygons</A>.
GRASS vector format does not store the polygons explicitly; they are
reconstructed by finding the particular arcs which form the polygon
perimeter.  Arcs that form linear features are sometimes called
<A HREF="./../../../../documents/html/help/16.glossary/line.def.html">lines</A> and arcs that outline areas are called area edges or area
lines.
