</P>i.group
    <P>i.group is an imagery program that allows the user to group any
of the raster imagery files that are present in the current
<A HREF="./../../../../documents/html/help/16.glossary/loc.def.html">location</A> and currently selected mapset into:
    <P>
  <CENTER>
    1.  a subgroup of the first group created during
  </CENTER>

  <CENTER>
    the tape extraction,
  </CENTER>
    <P>
  <CENTER>
    2.  a new imagery group, and subsequently, a subgroup
  </CENTER>

  <CENTER>
    of a new imagery group,
  </CENTER>
    <P>
  <CENTER>
    3.  an already existing group in the current location
  </CENTER>

  <CENTER>
    and mapset, and subsequently, a subgroup of an
  </CENTER>

  <CENTER>
    already existing group.
  </CENTER>
    <P>i.group also allows the user to remove raster imagery files from
a group in his or her mapset.  Raster files, however, cannot be
removed from, or added to, existing subgroups.  If a new subgroup
is needed, the procedure recommended is to create a new subgroup.
    <P>i.group is able to offer its options to all of the raster imagery
files in the mapsets that were selected using the GRASS command
<A HREF="./../../../../documents/html/g.mapsets.html">g.mapsets</A>.  i.group, however, is restricted to the files and
selected mapsets in the user's current GRASS location.
