</P>    <P>    <P>database - A collection of data sets stored together and controlled
by a specific schema.  A consistent and specified set of procedures
is used in adding data to a database and in changing or retrieving
existing data from it.  A GIS database includes data about the
positions and the attributes associated with geographic features that
have been coded as points, lines or areas.
    <P>In GRASS, the term database refers to the UNIX directory in which the
user's GRASS data are stored on a computer.  The variable $GISDBASE
is also used to refer to this directory.
