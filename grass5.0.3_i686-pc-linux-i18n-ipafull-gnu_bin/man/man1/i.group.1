       ii..ggrroouupp   -  An imagery function that creates and edits groups and sub-
       groups of (raster) imagery files.

       _i_._g_r_o_u_p allows the user to collect raster  map  layers  in  an  imagery
       group  by  assigning them to user-named subgroups or other groups. This
       enables the user to run analyses on any combination of the  raster  map
       layers  in  a  group.   The  user  creates the groups and subgroups and
       selects the raster map layers that are to reside in them. Imagery anal-
       ysis  programs  like _i_._r_e_c_t_i_f_y, _i_._o_r_t_h_o_._r_e_c_t_i_f_y and others ask the user
       for the name of an imagery group whose data are to be analyzed. Imagery
       analysis  programs like _i_._m_a_x_l_i_k ask the user for the imagery group and
       imagery subgroup whose data are to be analyzed.


       The interactive mode provides extended functionality.


       The first menu if the interactive mode in the _i_._g_r_o_u_p program asks  the
       user  to select a _g_r_o_u_p.  If the group does not exist, the user will be
       asked if he or she would like to create a new group.
       This program edits imagery groups. You may add raster map
       layers to, or remove such layers from, an imagery group.
       You may also create new groups.
              Please enter the group to be created/modified

         GROUP: _____________ (enter 'list' for a list of groups)


           AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT <ESC> TO CONTINUE
                          (OR <Ctrl-C> TO EXIT)

       If the word _l_i_s_t is entered, groups that have already been  created  in
       the  user's  current  LOCATION_NAME  and MAPSET(S) will be listed.  The
       second menu in _i_._g_r_o_u_p provides the user with the following options:
            1.    Select a different group
            2.    Edit group TITLE
            3.    Include new raster (cell) files in the group
                  or remove raster (cell) files from the group
            4.    Assign colors to the group
            5.    Create a new subgroup within the group

                  RETURN to exit



       The options are described as follows:

              _S_e_l_e_c_t _a _d_i_f_f_e_r_e_n_t _g_r_o_u_p
              If option number 1 is chosen, the following menu is displayed:
                   Please enter the group to be created/modified

              GROUP: _____________ (enter 'list' for a list of groups)


                AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT <ESC> TO CONTINUE
                               (OR <Ctrl-C> TO EXIT)

              If the word _l_i_s_t is entered, groups that have already been  cre-
              ated  in  the  current  LOCATION_NAME and MAPSET(S) will be dis-
              played.

              If option number 2 is selected, an entry space  is  provided  to
              type  in  the  group TITLE.  This TITLE is useful in identifying
              each group:
                   TITLE______________________________________


              This option offers an opportunity to go back and change
              the entry if it is not correct by asking: Look ok?
              (y/n).

              When choosing option number 3, the following menu is displayed:
                  LOCATION: location   GROUP: spot   MAPSET: demo

              If you wish to delete a file from group [spot], remove
              the 'x' from in front of the file name.

                               x_    spot.1 in demo
                               x_    spot.2 in demo
                               x_    spot.3 in demo


                AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT <ESC> TO CONTINUE
                              (OR <Ctrl-C> TO CANCEL)

              Next,a  menu  listing all the other raster map layers present in
              the current MAPSET(S) will be displayed:
               LOCATION: location      GROUP: spot      MAPSET: demo

              Please mark an 'x' by the files to be added in
              group [spot]

                                   MAPSET: demo

                                  x_   composite1
                                  x_   spotclass1
                                  __   spotclass2

                AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT <ESC> TO CONTINUE
                              (OR <Ctrl-C> TO CANCEL)

              If more than one MAPSET is selected,  menus  for  those  mapsets
              will  also be displayed.  All raster map layers selected with an
              'x' will be included in the group being updated.


       The user will then have the opportunity to check the  contents  of  the
       group that was just modified:
        Group [spot] references the following raster files

                         __________________
                        spot.1       in demo
                        spot.2       in demo
                        spot.3       in demo
                        composite1   in demo
                        spotclass1   in demo
                         __________________
                           Look ok? (y/n)

       If  the  user responds with the letter _y then the following sentence is
       displayed on the screen:
       Group [spot] updated!

       And the main menu for _i_._g_r_o_u_p returns.


       If the user responds _n, the menu containing the group  files  after  it
       was modified will be displayed and the user will be asked to place an _x
       in front of those raster map layers that are to  be  removed  from  the
       group.   Then, a menu listing all of the other raster map layers in the
       current MAPSET will be displayed again, and  the  user  will  be  again
       asked to place an _x in front of raster map layers to be included in the
       group.  This gives the user the opportunity to correct mistakes or make
       changes  in  the  choice of raster map layers to be selected in a group
       without exiting _i_._g_r_o_u_p.

              _A_s_s_i_g_n _c_o_l_o_r_s _t_o _t_h_e _g_r_o_u_p
              Option number 4 provides the following menu:
              Please indicate which files to use for red, green, and
              blue colors.  You may leave any color out. You may
              specify more than one color per file.  However, each
              color may only be specified once.  For example, to get
              a full color image, specify r,g,b for 3 different
              files.  To get a grey scale image, specify rgb for a
              single file.

                              (OR <Ctrl-C> TO CANCEL)

              This menu allows you to select a color for each imagery band  or
              for each file for display.  Note, however, that composite images
              and classified images are already assigned colors  during  their
              creation.


       An opportunity to change the choice of colors is offered after escaping
       the menu by:
       Look ok? (y/n)

              The following menu enables the user to create a subgroup out  of
              any  combination  of raster map layers in the group.  Any number
              of subgroups may be created by repeating the option.

                              (OR <Ctrl-C> TO CANCEL)

              After selecting or creating a subgroup, this menu is displayed:

              The user is then given the opportunity to check the contents  of
              the subgroup:
              Subgroup [123] references the following raster

              If  the  user  responds  with  the letter _n, the group menu will
              appear again enabling the user to select raster  map  layers  to
              form the subgroup.
