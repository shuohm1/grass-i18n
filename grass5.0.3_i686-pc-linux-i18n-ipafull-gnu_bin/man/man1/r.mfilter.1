       _r_._m_f_i_l_t_e_r filters the raster _i_n_p_u_t to produce the raster _o_u_t_p_u_t accord-
       ing to the matrix _f_i_l_t_e_r designed by the user (see _F_I_L_T_E_R_S below).  The
       filter is applied _r_e_p_e_a_t times (default _v_a_l_u_e is 1).  The _o_u_t_p_u_t raster
       map  layer  can be given a _T_I_T_L_E if desired.  (This TITLE should be put
       in quotes if it contains more than one word.)

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       The program can be run either non-interactively or  interactively.   To
       run  _r_._m_f_i_l_t_e_r  non-interactively, the user should specify desired flag
       settings and parameter values on the command line, using the form:


       rr..mmffiilltteerr  [--qqppzz]  iinnppuutt==_n_a_m_e  oouuttppuutt==_n_a_m_e  ffiilltteerr==_n_a_m_e  [rreeppeeaatt==_v_a_l_u_e]
       [TTIITTLLEE==_"_p_h_r_a_s_e_"]



       If  the user specifies _i_n_p_u_t, _o_u_t_p_u_t, and _f_i_l_t_e_r file names on the com-
       mand line, other parameters whose values are unspecified on the command
       line will be set to their default values (see below).


       Alternately,  the  user  can simply type rr..mmffiilltteerr on the command line,
       without program arguments.  In this case, the user will be prompted for
       flag  settings  and  parameter  values  using the standard GRASS parser
       interface described in the manual entry for _p_a_r_s_e_r.



   FFllaaggss::
       --qq     _r_._m_f_i_l_t_e_r will normally print messages to indicate  what  is  is
              doing  as  it  proceeds.  If the user specifies the -q flag, the
              program will run quietly.

       --zz     The filter is applied only to zero category values in the  input
              raster map layer.  The non-zero category values are not changed.
              Note that if there is more than one filter step,  this  rule  is
              applied  to the intermediate raster map layer -- only zero cate-
              gory values which result from the first filter will be  changed.
              In  most  cases  this  will NOT be the desired result.  Hence -z
              should be used only with single step filters.

              The  number  of  times  the _f_i_l_t_e_r is to be applied to the _i_n_p_u_t
              data.

       The  _f_i_l_t_e_r  file is a normal UNIX ASCII file designed by the user.  It
       has the following format:
            TITLE      TITLE
            MATRIX     n
                         .
            n lines of n integers
                         .
            DIVISOR    d
            TYPE        S/P


       TITLE  A one-line TITLE for the filter.  If a TITLE was  not  specified
              on the command line, it can be specified here.  This TITLE would
              be used to construct a TITLE for the resulting raster map layer.
              It should be a one-line description of the filter.

       MATRIX The  matrix  (n  x n) follows on the next n lines.  _n must be an
              odd integer greater than or equal to 3.  The matrix itself  con-
              sists  of  n rows of n integers.  The integers must be separated
              from each other by at least 1 blank.

       DIVISOR
              The filter divisor is _d.  If not specified, the  default  is  1.
              If the divisor is zero (0), then the divisor is dependent on the
              category values in the neighborhood (see HOW  THE  FILTER  WORKS
              below).

       TYPE   The filter type.  _S means sequential, while _P mean parallel.  If
              not specified, the default is S.


       Sequential filtering happens in place.  As the filter is applied to the
       raster  map layer, the category values that were changed in neighboring
       cells affect the resulting category value of  the  current  cell  being
       filtered.


       Parallel  filtering  happens in such a way that the original raster map
       layer category values are used to produce the new category value.




       More than one filter may be specified in the filter  file.   The  addi-
       tional  filter(s)  are described just like the first.  For example, the
       following describes two filters:

       The  filter  process produces a new category value for each cell in the
       input raster map layer by multiplying the category values of the  cells
       in  the  n x n neighborhood around the center cell by the corresponding
       matrix value and adding them together.  If a divisor is specified,  the
       sum is divided by this divisor, rounding to the nearest integer.  (If a
       zero divisor was specified, then the divisor is computed for each  cell
       as  the  sum of the MATRIX values where the corresponding input cell is
       non-zero.)


       If more than one filter step is specified, either  because  the  repeat
       value  was  greater  than one or because the filter file contained more
       than one matrix, these steps are  performed  sequentially.  This  means
       that  first  one filter is applied to the entire input raster map layer
       to produce an intermediate result; then the next filter is  applied  to
       the intermediate result to produce another intermediate result;  and so
       on, until the final filter is applied.  Then the output cell  is  writ-
       ten.

NNOOTTEESS
       If the resolution of the geographic region does not agree with the res-
       olution of the raster map layer, unintended resampling of the  original
       data  may occur.  The user should be sure that the geographic region is
       set properly.
