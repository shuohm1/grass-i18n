       This program provides a way to generate new maps based on an  intersec-
       tion  of  two  existing  maps.   It  in effect provides a way to create
       masked versions of vector maps.  Lines, sites, and polygons are clipped
       correctly.  By default v.cutter will extract line-type arcs.

       --qq     Run quietly.  Don't print percent information.

       --oo     Only  intersect  labeled areas.  Intersection of unlabeled areas
              may  not  be  dependable.   The  flag  is  meaningful  only  for
              type=area or type=both.

       --aa     Extract  area-edge  arc types only.  The flag is meaningful only
              for type=line or type=both.  By default the  program  uses  both
              area-edge and line arc types.

       --ll     Extract  line  arc  types only.  The flag is meaningful only for
              type=line or type=both.  By default the program uses both  area-
              edge and line arc types.

       ccuutttteerr==_m_a_p_n_a_m_e
              Name of the binary vector file to use for the cookie cutter.

       iinnppuutt==_m_a_p_n_a_m_e
              Name of the binary vector file which is to be cut.

       oouuttppuutt==_m_a_p_n_a_m_e
              Name of new vector file to be created.

       ttyyppee==_o_b_j_e_c_t _t_y_p_e
              Type  of object (area, line or both) to extract.  The default is
              to extract lines.




NNOOTTEESS
       If v.cutter is only used to extract lines then  it  automatically  runs
       _v_._s_u_p_p_o_r_t  on the output file.  If v.cutter is used to extract polygons
       then the user may need to run  _v_._s_p_a_g  _-_i  after  running  _v_._c_u_t_t_e_r  to
       remove identical lines.


       If  type=area  then  the edge created by the cutter file will appear on
       closed polygons in the output. If type=line  then  the  edge  does  not
       appear in the output.


       The  attributes of the output map will be generated from the attributes
       of the _i_n_p_u_t map.

BBUUGGSS
       There are a few rare situations that are  not  currently  handled  cor-
       rectly.   These  mostly  involve nodes or vertices intersecting exactly
       with lines of the opposite map.  You will know  you  have  hit  one  of
       these cases because a lot of strange text will start spitting out.


       Borders between areas with the same attributes are not dissolved.


       There are many places where the code could be optimized greatly.
