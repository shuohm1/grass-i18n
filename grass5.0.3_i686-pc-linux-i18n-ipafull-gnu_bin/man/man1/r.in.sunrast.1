       This  program converts a SUN raster file that has been created by SUN's
       "screendump" utility to a GRASS raster file.  Output is placed  in  the
       _/_c_e_l_l directory under the user's current GRASS mapset.


       The  program  prompts the user to enter the name of the SUN raster file
       to be converted and the name to be assigned to the GRASS raster file to
       contain the resultant image.


       It  is  recommended  that  this  program be used in an x,y database (as
       opposed to, for example, a UTM data base), since  the  cell  header  is
       created  with  nonsense coordinates (i.e., coordinates designed only to
       specify the number of rows and columns in the image).  Of  course,  the
       user can adjust the cell header after import using _r_._s_u_p_p_o_r_t .


       The  user  must, of course, first create the SUN raster file to be con-
       verted, either by running the SUN "screendump" utility  (to  capture  a
       displayed  image)  or by some other means (e.g., from a scanning system
       that produces SUN raster file format).

NNOOTTEE
       If you are using the screendump utility on a SUN workstation to  create
       the  sun  rasterfile,  do not use the _-_e option.  This option creates a
       sun rasterfile format that _r_._i_n_._s_u_n_r_a_s_t does not understand.
