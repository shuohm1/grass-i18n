       ing a coordinate transformation for each cell in the image using param-
       eters computed by the GRASS programs _p_h_o_t_o_._2_i_m_a_g_e and _p_h_o_t_o_._2_t_a_r_g_e_t.

       _p_h_o_t_o_._r_e_c_t_i_f_y rectifies an image by using the image to photo coordinate
       transformation  matrix  created  by  photo.2image and the rectification
       parameters created by photo.2target. Rectification is  the  process  by
       which  the  geometry  of  an image is made planimetric.  This is accom-
       plished by mapping an image from one coordinate system to  another.  In
       photo.rectify the parameters computed by photo.2image and photo.2target
       are used in equations to convert x,y image coordinates to standard  map
       coordinates for each pixel in the image.  The result is an image with a
       standard map coordinate system, compensated for relief distortions  and
       photographic  tilt.  Upon completion of the program the rectified image
       is deposited in a previously targeted GRASS LOCATION.

        You are asked to select the file(s) within the  imagery  group  to  be
       rectified:

        Please select the file(s) to rectify by naming an output file


       gs13.1    in    PERMANENT      gs13.orect...    gs14.1   in   PERMANENT
       .............  (enter list by any name to get a list of  existing  cell
       files) AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT  TO CONTINUE (OR  TO CANCEL)





       More than one file may be rectified at a time.  Each file should have a
       unique output file name.


       The next prompt asks you to select one of two windows:



             Please select one of the following options
             1.   Use the current window in the target location
             2.   Determine the smallest window which covers the image
             >


        _p_h_o_t_o_._r_e_c_t_i_f_y will only rectify that portion of the image that  occurs
       within  the  chosen window.  Only that portion will be relocated in the
       target database. It is therefore important to check the current  window
       in the target LOCATION if choice number one is selected.


       _p_h_o_t_o_._r_e_c_t_i_f_y will run in the background and notify you by mail when it
       is finished. The process may take an hour or more depending on the size
       of  the  image,  the  number  files, and the size and resolution of the
       selected window.

        The rectified image will be located in the target  LOCATION  when  the
       program  is  completed. The original unrectified files are not modified
       or removed.
