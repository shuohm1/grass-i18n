       _r_._g_r_o_w adds one cell around the perimeters of all areas in a user-spec-
       ified raster map layer and stores the output in a new raster map layer.


       An area consists of any contiguous clump of cells with  non-zero  cate-
       gory  values.  No distinction is made between differing category values
       within an area. Rather, a border is grown around the  outside  of  each
       entire contiguous set of non-zero cells.


       The  oouuttppuutt  raster map layer will not go outside the boundaries set in
       the current geographic region.  Thus, if a contiguous area in the iinnppuutt
       raster  map  layer  extends  to  the geographic edge of the current map
       layer, no new border cells can be added to that side of the area.


       Growth around a rectangular area in the iinnppuutt  raster  map  layer  will
       occur  straight out from each edge, but not diagonally from the corners
       of the rectangle. Thus, the "grown"  border  area  will  contain  lines
       along the edge of the original rectangle, but the corners of the border
       will not be squared off.  Instead, the lines of  the  border  which  go
       along  each  side of the original rectangle will touch only at the cor-
       ners of the cells at the end of each line.

       The user can run _r_._g_r_o_w either interactively or non-interactively.  The
       program  is run interactively if the user types rr..ggrrooww without specify-
       ing flag settings and parameter values on the command  line.   In  this
       case, the user will be prompted for input.


       Alternately,  the  user can run _r_._g_r_o_w non-interactively, by specifying
       the names of an iinnppuutt and oouuttppuutt map layer, and including  any  desired
       flags, on the command line.



   FFllaaggss::
       --bb     Output  a  binary raster map layer having only zero-one category
              values, regardless of the  category  values  in  the  iinnppuutt  map
              layer.   In  this case, all cells with a non-zero category value
              in the iinnppuutt map layer are assigned to category 1 in the  oouuttppuutt
              map  layer.  If the -b flag is not used, these cells will retain
              their original non-zero category values.  In  either  case,  all
              cells  whose category value is changed from 0 during the growing
              process are assigned a category value of 1 in the oouuttppuutt map.

       --qq     Run quietly, supressing printing of  information  about  program
              progress to standard output.




   PPaarraammeetteerrss::
       iinnppuutt==_n_a_m_e
              Name  of  an  existing  raster  map  layer in the user's current
              mapset search path containing areas to be "grown".

       oouuttppuutt==_n_a_m_e
              Name of the new raster map  layer  to  contain  program  output.
              This map will be binary if the user sets the -b flag. Otherwise,
              iinnppuutt map cells having  non-zero  category  values  will  retain
              their  original  values.  In either case, all cells whose values
              changed during growth will be assigned category value 1  in  the
              oouuttppuutt map.

       The _r_._g_r_o_w command can be used to represent the boundary of one or more
       areas. In this case, the zero-one (binary) output option should NOT  be
       used.  Then  the  iinnppuutt map layer can be subtracted from the oouuttppuutt map
       layer using the _r_._m_a_p_c_a_l_c command.  All original non-zero category val-
       ues  will  be  subtracted  out,  leaving  the boundary areas only. This
       resulting zero-one boundary  depiction  can  be  displayed  over  other
       related raster map layers using the overlay option of _d_._r_a_s_t.


       If  the resolution of the current geographic region does not agree with
       the resolution of the input raster map layer, unintended resampling  of
       the  original raster map layer may occur.  The user should be sure that
       the current geographic region is set properly.
