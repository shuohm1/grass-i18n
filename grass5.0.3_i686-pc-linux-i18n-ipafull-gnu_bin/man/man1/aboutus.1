       The GRASS Development Team is pleased to announce this new home for the
       open source  Geographic  Resources  Analysis  Support  System  (GRASS).
       GRASS  has been under continual development since 1982 and has involved
       a large number of federal US agencies, universities, and private compa-
       nies.   The core components of GRASS and the management of the integra-
       tion of the efforts into GRASS releases were accomplished by  the  Con-
       struction  Engineering  Resesarch Laboratory (CERL) in Champaign, Illi-
       nois.  CERL completed the last combined release of GRASS as version 4.1
       in  1992 and provided updates and patches to this release through 1995.
       It has been estimated that several million dollars  of  GRASS  software
       development efforts across the government have been completed since the
       4.1 release. Since 1997 GRASS is developed by a consortium of worldwide
       researcher and programmers at universities and private companies. GRASS
       GIS is released under GNU General Public License.


       PPllaannss

       We have several goals for the release of GRASS including:

                     _W_e _h_a_v_e _r_e_l_e_a_s_e_d _G_R_A_S_S _v_e_r_s_i_o_n _4_._2_._x GRASS 4.2.x consists
                     of  the  GRASS  4.1  engine with the addition of many new
                     programs that have been submitted by the user  community.

                     making GRASS available to the greatest audience possible,
                     are releasing new versions of the documentation. The cur-
                     rent Users, Programmers, and Installation Guides are cur-
                     rently available in Adobe PDF format.

                     sion includes support for floating-point numbers and  the
                     separation  of  0 and null.  This version of GRASS gener-
                     ates DIFFERENT grass format files due to the floating and
                     null support.


       CCuurrrreenntt SSttaattuuss

       As of December 1997, we have released GRASS 4.2 to the public.  GRASS 5
       has been released under GPL license in Oktober 1999 and already  under-
       gone several beta releases towards GRASS 5.0stable.

       Our  main  goal  is to keep GRASS alive and prospering and available to
       the user community.  We hope that the continued interest in GRASS  will
       result in its further development and enhancement.
