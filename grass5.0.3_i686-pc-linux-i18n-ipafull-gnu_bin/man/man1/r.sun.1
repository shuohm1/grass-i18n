       rr..ssuunn  -  Computes  beam  (direct),  diffuse and ground reflected solar
       irradiation raster maps for given  day,  latitude,  surface  and  atmo-
       spheric conditions.  Solar parameters (e.g. time of sunrise and sunset,
       declination, extraterrestrial irradiance, daylight length) are saved in
       a  local  text  file. Alternatively, the local time can be specified to
       compute solar incidence angle and/or irradiance raster maps. The  shad-
       owing effect of the topography is optionally incorporated.

       The  solar geometry of the model is based on the works of Krcho (1990),
       later improved by Jenco (1992). The equations  describing  Sun  &#8211;
       Earth  position  as  well as an interaction of the solar radiation with
       atmosphere were originally based on the formulas  suggested  by  Kitler
       and  Mikler  (1986).  This  component  was  considerably updated by the
       results and suggestions of the working group co-ordinated  by  Scharmer
       and Greif (2000) (this algorithm might be replaced by SOLPOS algorithm-
       library included in GRASS within r.sunmask command). The model computes
       all  three components of global radiation (beam, diffuse and reflected)
       for the clear sky conditions, i.e. not taking  into  consideration  the
       spatial  and temporal variation of clouds. The extent and spatial reso-
       lution of the modelled area, as well as integration over time, are lim-
       ited  only by the memory and data storage resources. The model is built
       to fulfil user needs in various fields of science (hydrology, climatol-
       ogy,  ecology  and  environmental sciences, photovoltaics, engineering,
       etc.) for continental, regional up to the landscape scales.

       As an option the model considers a shadowing effect of the local topog-
       raphy.   The  r.sun works in two modes. In the first mode it calculates
       for the set local time a solar  incidence  angle  [degrees]  and  solar
       irradiance  values  [W.m-2].   In  the  second mode daily sums of solar
       radiation [Wh.m-2.day-1] are computed within a set day. By a  scripting
       the  two  modes  can  be used separately or in a combination to provide
       estimates for any desired time interval. The  model  accounts  for  sky
       obstruction  by  local  relief  features.  Several solar parameters are
       saved in a local text file named _r_._s_u_n___o_u_t_._t_x_t.

       The solar incidence angle raster map _i_n_c_i_d_o_u_t  is  computed  specifying
       elevation  raster  map _e_l_e_v_i_n, aspect raster map _a_s_p_i_n, slope steepness
       raster map _s_l_o_p_i_n_, given the day _d_a_y and local time _t_i_m_e. There  is  no
       need  to  define  latitude for locations with known and defined projec-
       tion/coordinate system (check it out using g.projinfo command). If  you
       have  undefined projection, (x,y) system, etc. then the latitude can be
       defined explicitely for large areas by  input  raster  map  _l_a_t_i_n  with
       interpolated  latitude  values  or,  for smaller areas, a single region
       latitude value _l_a_t can be used instead. All input raster maps  must  be
       floating point (FCELL) raster maps. Null data in maps are excluded from
       the computation (and also speeding-up the computation), so each  output
       raster  map  will  contain  null  data  in cells according to all input
       raster maps. The user can use r.null command to create/reset null  file
       for your input raster maps.

       The  specified  day  _d_a_y  is  the number of the day of the general year
       where January 1 is day no.1 and December 31 is 365. Time _t_i_m_e must be a
       local  (solar)  time  (i.e.  NOT a zone time, e.g. GMT, CET) in decimal
       system, e.g. 7.5 (= 7h 30m A.M.), 16.1 = 4h 6m P.M..

       Setting the solar declination _d_e_c_l_i_n by user is an option  to  override
       the value computed by the internal routine for the day of the year. The
       value of geographical latitude can be set as a constant for  the  whole
       computed  region  or,  as an option, a grid representing spatially dis-
       tributed values over a large region. The geographical latitude must  be
       also in decimal system with positive values for northern hemisphere and
       negative for southern one.  In similar principle  the  Linke  turbidity
       factor (_l_i_n_k_e_i_n, _l_i_n ) and ground albedo (_a_l_b_e_d_o, _a_l_b) can be set.

       Besides  clear-sky  radiations,  user  can compute a real-sky radiation
       (beam, diffuse) using _c_o_e_f_b_h and _c_o_e_f_d_h input raster maps defining  the
       fraction  of the respective clear-sky radiations reduced by atmospheric
       factors (e.g. cloudiness). Usually these coefficients can  be  obtained
       from a long-terms meteorological measurements.

       The  solar  irradiation  or irradiance raster maps _b_e_a_m___r_a_d, _d_i_f_f___r_a_d ,
       _r_e_f_l___r_a_d are computed for a given day _d_a_y_, latitude _l_a_t _(_l_a_t_i_n_)_, eleva-
       tion  _e_l_e_v_i_n,  slope _s_l_o_p_e_i_n and aspect _a_s_p_i_n raster files. The program
       uses the Linke atmosphere turbidity factor and  ground  albedo  coeffi-
       cient.  A  default, single value of Linke factor is _l_i_n=3.0 and is near
       the annual average for rural-city areas. The Linke factor for an  abso-
       lutely clear atmosphere is _l_i_n=1.0. See notes below to learn more about
       this factor. The incidence solar angle is the angle between horizon and
       solar  beam vector. The solar radiation maps for given day are computed
       integrating the relevant irradiance between sunrise  and  sunset  times
       for  given  day.  The user can set finer or coarser time step _s_t_e_p used
       for all-day radiation calculations. A default  value  of  _s_t_e_p  is  0.5
       hour. Larger steps (e.g. 1.0-2.0) can speed-up calculations but produce
       less reliable results. The output units are in Wh per squared meter per
       given  day  [Wh/(m*m)/day]. The incidence angle and irradiance/irradia-
       tion maps can be computed without  shadowing  influence  of  relief  by
       default  or they can be computed with this influence using the flag _-_s.
       In mountainous areas this can lead to very different results! The  user
       should  be aware that taken into account the shadowing effect of relief
       can slow down the speed of computing especially when the  sun  altitude
       is  low.   When considering shadowing effect (flag _-_s) speed and preci-
       sion computing can be controlled by a parameter _d_i_s_t which defines  the
       sampling  density at which the visibility of a grid cell is computed in
       the direction of a path of the solar flow. It also defines  the  method
       by  which  the obstacle's altitude is computed. When choosing _d_i_s_t less
       than 1.0 (i.e. sampling points will be computed at _d_i_s_t * cellsize dis-
       tance),  r.sun takes altitude from the nearest grid point. Values above
       1.0 will use the maximum altitude value found in  the  nearest  4  sur-
       rounding grid points. The default value _d_i_s_t=1.0 should give reasonable
       results for most cases (e.g.  on DEM). _D_i_s_t value defines a multiplying
       coefficient  for sampling distance. This basic sampling distance equals
       to the arithmetic average of both cell sizes. The reasonable values are
       in  the  range  0.5-1.5.  The values below 0.5 will decrease and values
       above 1.0 will increase the computing speed. Values  greater  than  2.0
       may  produce  estimates with lower accuracy in highly dissected relief.
       The fully shadowed areas are written to the ouput maps as zero  values.
       Areas with NULL data are considered as no barrier with shadowing effect
       .

       The text file _r_._s_u_n___o_u_t_._t_x_t is  generated  with  the  following  listed
       parameters used in the computation:

       - Solar constant 1367 W.m-2

       -  Extraterrestrial  irradiance  on  a plane perpendicular to the solar
       beam [W.m-2]

       - Day of the year

       - Declination [radians]

       - Decimal hour (Alternative 1 only)

       - Sunrise and sunset (min-max) over a horizontal plane

       - Daylight lengths

       - Geographical latitude (min-max)

       - Linke turbidity factor (min-max)

       - Ground albedo (min-max)

       The user can use a nice shellcript with variable day to compute  radia-
       tion  for some time interval within the year (e.g. vegetation or winter
       period). Elevation, aspect and slope input values should not be reclas-
       sified into coarser categories. This could lead to incorrect results.

       The  user  can  run  this program either interactively or non- interac-
       tively. The program will be run non-interactively if the user specifies
       program arguments and flag settings on the command line using the form:

       r.sun   [-s]   elevin=name   aspin=name   slopein=name   [linkein=name]
       [lin=value]    [albedo=name]   [alb=value]   [latin=name]   [lat=value]
       [coefbh=name]    [coefdh=name]    [incidout=name]     [insol_time=name]
       [beam_rad=name]  [diff_rad=name] [refl_rad=name] day=value [step=value]
       [declin=value] [time=value] [dist=value]

       Alternately, the user can simply type _r_._s_u_n on the command line without
       program  arguments. In this case, the user will be prompted for parame-
       ter values using the standard GRASS parser interface. Currently,  there
       are  two  modes  of r.sun.  In the first mode it calculates solar inci-
       dence angle and solar irradiance raster maps using the set local  time.
       In  the second mode daily sums of solar irradiation [kWh.m-2.day-1] are
       computed for a specified day.

NNOOTTEESS
       Solar  energy  is an important input parameter in different models con-
       cerning energy  industry,  landscape,  vegetation,  evapotranspiration,
       snowmelt  or  remote  sensing.  Solar  rays incidence angle maps can be
       effectively used in radiometric and topographic  corrections  in  moun-
       tainous  and hilly terrain where very accurate investigations should be
       performed.


       The clear-sky solar radiation model applied in the r.sun  is  based  on
       the  work  undertaken for development of European Solar Radiation Atlas
       (Scharmer and Greif 2000, Page et al. 2001, Rigollier 2001). The  clear
       sky model estimates the global radiation from the sum of its beam, dif-
       fuse and reflected components.  The main difference between solar radi-
       ation  models  for  inclined surfaces in Europe is the treatment of the
       diffuse component. In the European climate this component is often  the
       largest  source  of  estimation  error.  Taking  into consideration the
       existing models and their limitation the European Solar Radiation Atlas
       team  selected  the  Muneer  (1990) model as it has a sound theoretical
       basis and thus more potential for later improvement.


       Details of underlying equations used in this program can  be  found  in
       the  reference  literature cited below or book published by Neteler and
       Mitasova: Open Source GIS: A GRASS GIS Approach  (published  in  Kluwer
       Academic Publishers in 2002).

       currently uses a lot  of  memory,  some  improvements  are  under  way.
       Planned
