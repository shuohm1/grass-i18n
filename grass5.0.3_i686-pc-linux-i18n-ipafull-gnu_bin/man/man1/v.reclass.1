       _v_._r_e_c_l_a_s_s creates an output map layer based  on  an  input  vector  map
       layer.  The  output  map  layer will be a reclassification of the input
       map layer based on reclass rules input to _v_._r_e_c_l_a_s_s.  A title  for  the
       output map layer may be (optionally) specified by the user.


       The  reclass  rules  are  read from standard input (i.e., from the key-
       board, redirected from a file, or piped through another program).

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       The user can run this  program  either  non-interactively  or  interac-
       tively.   The  program will be run non-interactively if the user speci-
       fies program arguments and flag settings on the command line using  the
       form:


       _v_._r_e_c_l_a_s_s   _[_-_d_]   _i_n_p_u_t_=_n_a_m_e   _o_u_t_p_u_t_=_n_a_m_e  _t_y_p_e_=_a_r_e_a_,  _l_i_n_e_, _o_r  _s_i_t_e
       _[_t_i_t_l_e_=_n_a_m_e_]


       After the user types in the above information on the command line,  the
       program will (silently) prompt the user for reclass rules to be applied
       to the input  map  layer  categories.   The  form  of  these  rules  is
       described  in further detail in the sections on non-interactive program
       use reclass rules and examples, below.

       Alternately, the user can simply type _v_._r_e_c_l_a_s_s on  the  command  line,
       without program arguments.  In this case, the user will be prompted for
       all needed inputs.  Before using _v_._r_e_c_l_a_s_s one must know the following:


       1       The  new categories desired; and, which old categories fit into
       which new categories.


       2      The names of the new categories.

       Suppose we want to reclassify the vector map layer roads, consisting of
       five  categories,  into  the three new categories: paved roads, unpaved
       roads, and railroad tracks.  The user is asked whether the reclass  ta-
       ble  is  to be established with each category value initially set to 0,
       or with each category value initially set to its own value.   A  screen
       like that shown below then appears, listing the categories of the roads
       vector map layer to be reclassified and prompting the user for the  new
       category values to be assigned them.

       In  the  following  screen  the  new  category values have been entered
       beside the appropriate old category  names.   Cells  assigned  category
       values 2, 3, and 4 in the old vector map layer are now assigned the new
       category value 2 in the reclassed map; cell data formerly  assigned  to
       category  value  5  in  the old vector map map are now assigned the new
       category value 3 in the reclassed map.

       prompts  the user to enter a new title and category label for the newly
       reclassed categories.

       Based upon the information supplied by the user  in  the  above  sample
       screens,  the new output map and supporting category files are created.

NNOONN--IINNTTEERRAACCTTIIVVEE PPRROOGGRRAAMM UUSSEE:: RREECCLLAASSSS RRUULLEESS
       In non-interactive program use, the names of an input map, output  map,
       type  of input map, and output map title are given on the command line.
       However, the reclass rules are still read from  standard  input  (i.e.,
       from  the  keyboard,  redirected  from a file, or piped through another
       program).


       Once the user has specified an input vector map layer, output map layer
       name,  type of input map layer, and (optionally) output map layer title
       by typing:


       _v_._r_e_c_l_a_s_s  _[_-_d  _]  _i_n_p_u_t_=_n_a_m_e  _o_u_t_p_u_t_=_n_a_m_e  _t_y_p_e_=_a_r_e_a_,  _l_i_n_e_,  _o_r  _s_i_t_e
       _[_t_i_t_l_e_=_n_a_m_e_]


       Each line of input must have the following format:


       _i_n_p_u_t___c_a_t_e_g_o_r_i_e_s_=_o_u_t_p_u_t___c_a_t_e_g_o_r_y _[_l_a_b_e_l_]


       where  the  input lines specify the category values in the input vector
       map layer to be reclassified to the new output_category category value.
       Specification of a label to be associated with the new output map layer
       category is optional.  If specified, it is  recorded  as  the  category
       label  for  the new category value.  The equal sign = is required.  The
       input_category(ies) may consist of single category values or a range of
       such  values  in  the  format "low thru high."  The word "thru" must be
       present.


       A line containing only the word end terminates the input.

       The following examples may help clarify the reclass rules.


       1    This example reclassifies categories 1, 3 and 5 in the input  vec-
       tor  map  layer to category 1 with category label "poor quality" in the
       output map layer, and reclassifies input vector map layer categories 2,
       4,  and 6 to category 2 with the label "good quality" in the output map
       layer.
                 1 3 5   =  1   poor quality
                 2 4 6   =  2   good quality

       2    This example reclassifies input vector map layer categories 1 thru
       10  to  output map layer category 1, input map layer categories 11 thru
       20 to output map layer category 2, and input map  layer  categories  21
       thru 30 to output map layer category 3, all without labels.
                  1 thru 10       =   1
                 11 thru 20       =   2
                 21 thru 30       =   3

       3    Subsequent  rules  override  previous rules.  Therefore, the below
       example reclassifies input vector map layer categories 1 thru 19 and 51
       thru  100 to category 1 in the output map layer, input vector map layer
       categories 20 thru 24 and 26 thru 50 to the output map  layer  category
       2, and input vector map layer category 25 to the output category 3.
                 1 thru 100        =   1   poor quality
                 20 thru 50        =   2   medium quality
                  25     =   3   good quality

       4    The previous example could also have been entered as:
                  1 thru 19      51 thru 100   =   1     poor quality
                 20 thru 24      26 thru 50    =   2     medium quality
                      25        =   3     good quality

       or as:
                  1 thru 19         =     1   poor quality
                 51 thru 100    =    1
                 20 thru 24         =     2
                 26 thru 50         =     2   medium quality
                  25      =     3   good quality

       The  final  example was given to show how the labels are handled.  If a
       new category value appears in more than one rule (as is the  case  with
       new  category  values  1  and  2),  the  last label which was specified
       becomes the label for that category.   In  this  case  the  labels  are
       assigned exactly as in the two previous examples.

NNOOTTEESS
       The  _v_._r_e_c_l_a_s_s  program generates a new vector map layer. The _v_._s_u_p_p_o_r_t
       program will have to be run on the newly created vector  map  layer  to
       build topology.  The dissolve _[_-_d_] option will work on only those areas
       which are of the same conversion category value.   If  a  map  area  is
       inside  (island)  a  converted  area  and  is NOT converted to the same
       value, its boundaries are output to the resultant map.

       Category values which are not explicitly reclassified to a new value by
       the user will be reclassified to 0.
