       _s_._m_e_d_p performs median polish on an existing sites list.  The sites are
       overlayed  onto a grid (vveecctt==_n_a_m_e) and each site is associated with the
       closest node.  Therefore, sites do not necessarily have to be  oriented
       on  a  grid.  Each node may be associated with zero, one, or more sites
       and the grid may be rotated.  Also, the length of  each  box  does  not
       have to be equal to width of each box defining the grid.


       Once  sites  are  associated  with  nodes on a _p by _q grid, _p_+_q_+_1 extra
       storage locations are created (initialized to zero) to store _a_l_l,  _r_o_w,
       and  _c_o_l_u_m_n  effects.   The median of each row is removed from the data
       and added to the extra _p cells. Then, medians are removed from the data
       as  well  as  from  the _p cells containing _r_o_w effects.  The medians of
       data  in this pass are stored in the extra _q cells (_c_o_l_u_m_n effects) and
       the  median  of  the row effects is stored in the extra (_p_+_1_, _q_+_1) cell
       (_a_l_l effect). This is repeated until each successive  iteration  leaves
       each site unchanged (within a tolerance, described by [tthhrreesshh==_n]).

              in a binary vector file).

   PPaarraammeetteerrss::
       ssiitteess==_n_a_m_e
              Name of an existing sites file.

       vveecctt==_n_a_m_e
              Name of the grid file (binary vector file).

       oouuttppuutt==_n_a_m_e
              Name of the output file (binary vector file or sites list).

       rreeppoorrtt==_n_a_m_e
              Name of an ASCII file which shows original and residual data  in
              tabular form.

       tthhrreesshh==_n
              Threshold  to  determine  when  convergence  of median polish is
              obtained.  (default = 1).



       _s_._m_e_d_p can be run either non-interactively or interactively.  The  pro-
       gram will be run non-interactively if the user specifies the name of an
       existing _s_i_t_e_s list file, name for a _v_e_c_t file, and name of  an  _o_u_t_p_u_t
       file  using  the  form  ss..mmeeddpp [--aaeeqqss] ssiitteess==_n_a_m_e vveecctt==_n_a_m_e oouuttppuutt==_n_a_m_e
       [rreeppoorrtt==_n_a_m_e] [tthhrreesshh==_n]

       Alternately, the user can simply type ss..mmeeddpp on the command line, with-
       out  program  arguments.   In  this case, the user will be prompted for
       parameter values using the standard GRASS _p_a_r_s_e_r interface.

NNOOTTEESS
       When using the rreeppoorrtt option, the tabular report may be more  than  128
       columns  wide.  Therefore,  it may be useful to add a _T_e_X or _P_o_s_t_S_c_r_i_p_t
       wrapper before  printing  (e.g.,  eennssccrriipptt  --hh  --rr  --ffCCoouurriieerr--BBoolldd55  --pp
       rreeppoorrtt..ppss  rreeppoorrtt)  so  that the page is in landscape orientation and a
       very small font is used.


       The input vector file defining the grid should be large enough so  that
       the extreme east-west and north-south nodes (for non-rotated grids) can
       be used to store row and column effects. Otherwise, when residuals  _a_n_d
       effects  are  written  to the output file, residuals may share the same
       spatial location as effects when written to a vector output file.


       Currently, nothing is done with the residuals, but I would like  imple-
       ment  some  sort  of  analysis  of  these in the future (suggestions?).
       Kriging using these residuals as new data set is being planned.

       This  should  still be consider beta-release software.  Although I have
       repeated results shown in Cressie (1991), I  would  greatly  appreciate
       someone testing this further.


       The --ss flag is yet to be implemented.


       This  should  probably  be re-written to use points in a vector file as
       input (thus creating _v_._m_e_d_p).


       Ideally, I would also like to output three data files for plotting by a
       graphing program (e.g., _g_n_u_p_l_o_t), but I never got around to doing this.
       The classic plot is to show three surfaces:  data = trend +  residuals.
       The trend can be obtained by extrapolation and/or interpolation.


       Extrapolating  and interpolating using the row, column, and all effects
       to create a raster file would be a  nice  feature  to  include  in  the
       future.  Instead, I am considering retrieving the effects from the out-
       put file and creating the surface with separate program.
