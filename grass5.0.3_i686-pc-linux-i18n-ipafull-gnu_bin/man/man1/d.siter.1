       _d_._s_i_t_e_r is a script which calls s.info to determine the  number,  types
       and ranges of site attributes, then calls a tcl script which presents a
       user interface. On the interface there are two sliders for each  dimen-
       sion,  category,  or  decimal  attribute in the sites file. If a header
       with labels is in the file, the sliders will  be  labeled.   The  value
       range  for  each  slider pair is determined by the range for the corre-
       sponding attribute found in the sites file for sites within the current
       region.  At startup one slider in each pair is set at the minimum value
       and the other slider is set at the  maximum  value.  The  user  adjusts
       sliders  as  needed to set ranges of desired values for each attribute,
       dimension, or category. The interface also has controls for setting the
       size,  color, and type of marker, and buttons for ddiissppllaayy, eerraassee, rreesseett
       ssccaalleess, and qquuiitt.



              When  the  ddiissppllaayy  button  is   chosen,   the   GRASS   program
              d.sites.qual is called with rules derived from the current state
              of the interface and the specified subset is drawn in the active
              GRASS  monitor.  By adjusting the size, color and type of marker
              and drawing multiple subsets, the user may more easily visualize
              spatial  relationships of various subsets or determine inconsis-
              tant attribute values.

              Subsets may be saved by entering a filename in  the  text  entry
              box of the interface and choosing ssaavvee aass::.

              Due  to  the  limited  resolution of sliders and considering the
              wide range and distribution often found in site attribute  data,
              a  rreessccaallee  button  is provided. Choosing rreessccaallee results in the
              currently defined ranges becoming the new min and  max  and  the
              sliders  being  reset to their left and right extremes, allowing
              further refinement of the range.

              To undo the rreessccaallee operation, the user may select rreesseett  ssccaalleess
              which  resets  all  scales  to their startup values (loosing any
              ranges already specified).

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       This program can be run non-interactively or interactively. If the user
       gives  the  name of a GRASS site_lists map on the command line the pro-
       gram will be run non-interactively. Alternately, the user can type sim-
       ply  d.siter on the command line; in this case, the program will prompt
       the user for a site_lists map.

BBUUGGSS
       Due to pixel rounding, startup ranges for sliders may be  slightly  off
       for  floating  point  attributes. The slider min value will be slightly
       lower than the min value found in the file and  the  slider  max  value
       will be slightly higher.
