       ssiitteess..SS  - Description of the GRASS _s_._m_e_n_u "S" interface option.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       This  describes  the  GRASS  _s_._m_e_n_u  "S"  statistical package interface
       option.  See also the manual entry for _s_._m_e_n_u.

SSPPEECCIIAALL AADDJJUUSSTTMMEENNTT
       Due to the fact that "S" references all subscripts  beginning  with  1,
       and  the GIS data begins with 0, it was necessary to add 1 to the cate-
       gory numbers.  Therefore, category value 0 ("no data") becomes category
       value 1, category 1 becomes category 2, etc.

SS DDAATTAA SSTTRRUUCCTTUURREESS
       Below are descriptions of the data structures created by the interface.
       As a general comment, within "S", simply typing the data structure name
       will  display the values contained in the structure.  You may also find
       it interesting to display the data structures using  the  "S"  function
       _d_p_u_t_(_).

       ccaatt..hhiissttoo,, ((ccaatt..##..hhiissttoo))

       This structure contains the histogram for the
              categories in each map layer.  The histogram contains the number
              of cells of each category which occur in the  user's  geographic
              region (see wind.n, et al., below).  It is a 2-dimensional inte-
              ger array (matrix).  The  first  subscript  references  the  map
              layer.  The second subscript references the category value.

       Examples:
              cat.histo[2,5]  is  the  cell  count  for  layer  2, category 5.
              cat.histo[2,]  is the full histogram for layer 2.

       Note:  since more than one layer may occur in the data, and the  number
       of  categories  in  each  layer varies, it was necessary to create this
       structure with sufficient dimension to hold the largest category  value
       for  all  layers.  Histogram data for categories which do not occur are
       set to NA ("S" notation for "no data").   However,  there  is  also  an
       individual   histogram   structure   for   each   layer:   cat.1.histo,
       cat.2.histo, etc.  These are simple vectors.

       ccaatt..nnaammee
              This structure contains the names for the categories in each map
              layer.   It  is  a  2-dimensional character array (matrix).  The
              first subscript references the map layer.  The second  subscript
              references the category.

       Examples:
              cat.name[2,5]   is   the   name  of  category  5  for  layer  2.
              cat.name[2,]  are all category names for layer 2.

       Note:  since more than one layer may occur in the data, and the  number
       of  categories  in  each  layer varies, it was necessary to create this
       structure with sufficient dimension to hold the largest category  value
       for all layers.  Names for categories which do not occur are set to ''.
       However, there is also an individual category name structure  for  each
       layer:  cat.1.name, cat.2.name, etc.  These are simple vectors.

       ssiittee..ddaattaa
              This  structure  contains  the  data  for  each  site.   It is a
              3-dimensional integer array.  The first subscript references the
              categories  which  occurred  at  the site.  The second subscript
              references the site.  The third subscript references the  layer.

       Examples:
              site.data[,5,3]   is   the   data   for   site  5  in  layer  3.
              site.data[,2,]   is  the  data  for  site  2  in   all   layers.
              site.data[,,1]  is all site data for layer 1.

       Note:  the size of the first dimension will be the number of cells in a
       site, the size of the second dimension will be the number of sites, the
       size of the third dimension will be the number of layers.

       ssiittee..mmooddee
              Since  "S"  does  not  provide a statistical mode function, this
              structure contains the most frequently  occurring  category  for
              each  site  in  each layer.  It is a 2-dimensional integer array
              (matrix).  The first subscript references the site.  The  second
              subscript references the layer.

       Examples:
              site.mode[5,3] is the mode for site 5 in layer 3.  site.mode[2,]
              are the modes for site 2 in all layers.  site.mode[,1]  are  all
              site modes for layer 1.

       Note:   this  'mode'  is  not the strict definition of the mode.  Since
       category 0 (which in "S" is category 1) represents "no data" in the GIS
       databases,  it  was excluded from the mode calculations (essentially as
       if it had been NA).  For example, if the data for a site are 1 1 1 1  2
       2 3 2 3 1 1, the mode will be 2.

       llaayyeerr..nnaammee
              This  structure  contains  the  raster map layer names.  It is a
              2-dimensional array (i.e., a matrix).  The first subscript  ref-
              erences  the map layer.  The second subscript selects either the
              map layer name, or the map layer TITLE.

       Examples:
              layer.name[3,1] is the name of layer 3.  layer.name[3]   is also
              the  name  of  layer 3.  layer.name[2]   is the name of layer 2.
              layer.name[3,2] is the TITLE for layer 3.

       You  may  find  the  following  "S" macros helpful when referencing the
       'site.data' and 'site.mode' structures, since they allow you to specify
       parameters:
       MACRO site.data(site, layer)
       ({
            site.data[ , site, layer]
       })
       END


       MACRO site.mode(site, layer)
       ({
            site.mode[site, layer]
       })
       END
