       This program is used to start GRASS. It will  parse  the  command  line
       arguments  and then initialize GRASS for the user. Since GRASS programs
       require a specific environment, this program must be called before  any
       other  GRASS  program  can run. The command line arguments are optional
       and provide the user with a method to indicate the desired user  inter-
       face, as well as the desired mapset to work on.

FFEEAATTUURREESS
       The GRASS program will save both the desired user interface and mapset.
       Thus, the next time the user runs GRASS,  typing  _g_r_a_s_s_5  (without  any
       options)  will  start  grass  with  the  previous settings for the user
       interface and mapset.


       If you specify a graphical user interface (eg Tcl/Tk) the  _g_r_a_s_s_5  pro-
       gram  will  try to verify that the system you specified exists and that
       you can access it successfully. If  any  of  these  checks  fail,  then
       _g_r_a_s_s_5  will automatically switch back to the text user interface mode.

       The _g_r_a_s_s_5 program will check for the existence of an environment vari-
       able  called  GRASS_GUI  which indicates the type of user interface for
       GRASS to use. If this variable is not set when _g_r_a_s_s_5 is run,  then  it
       will be created and then saved in the $HOME/.grassrc5 file for the next
       time GRASS is run.


       There is an order of precedence in the way _g_r_a_s_s_5 determines  the  user
       interface  to  use.  The following is the hierarchy from highest prece-
       dence to lowest.


       The user may add own environment variable settings  to  $HOME/.grassrc5
       file  which  are used during next startup of GRASS (list of implemented
       environment variables).

       If you choose to use the Tcl/Tk graphical user interface, then the fol-
       lowing  environment  variables  can  be  used  to  override your system
       default tclsh and wish commands. See the section immediately  following
       the variable descriptions for an example.

       Example Use of GRASS Tcl/Tk Environment Variables


       Suppose  your system has Tcl/Tk 8.0 installed and you install your per-
       sonal version of Tcl/Tk 8.3 binaries installed under $HOME/bin. You can
       use  the  above  variables  to  have  GRASS use the Tcl/Tk 8.3 binaries
       instead.


       GRASS_TCLSH = $HOME/bin/tclsh8.3

       GRASS_WISH  = $HOME/bin/wish8.3

       This environment variables allows to extend the GRASS paths to  locally
       developed/installed modules which are not distributes through the stan-
       dard release of GRASS.


       GRASS_ADDON_PATH=/usr/mytools

       GRASS_ADDON_PATH=/usr/mytools:/usr/local/othertools


       In this example above path(s) would be added to the standard GRASS path
       environment.

       The  Synopsis  and  Options sections above describe options that can be
       used to set the location and mapset that GRASS will use.  These  values
       can  also  be  set  with environment variables. However, specifying the
       location and mapset variables on the command line will  override  these
       environment variables. The available variables are as follows:

       LLOOCCAATTIIOONN
              A  fully  qualified  path  to  a  mapset  (eg  /usr/local/grass-
              Data/spearfish/PERMANENT). This environment  variable  overrides
              the GISDBASE, LOCATION_NAME, and MAPSET variables.

       GGIISSDDBBAASSEE
              Initial  database  directory  which  should be a fully qualified
              path (eg /usr/local/grassData)

       LLOOCCAATTIIOONN__NNAAMMEE
              Initial location directory which is a subdirectory of GISDBASE

       MMAAPPSSEETT Initial mapset  directory  which  is  a  subdirectory  of  LOCA-
              TION_NAME



       There  are  a  variety  of ways in which these variables can be used to
       specify the mapset to use. The following are some possible examples.

       EExxaammppllee 11
              The environment variables are defined as follows:

              LOCATION = /usr/local/grassData/spearfish/PERMANENT

              GISDBASE = /usr/local/grassData

              LOCATION_NAME = spearfish

              MAPSET = PERMANENT

              Start GRASS with the following command:

              grass5 -

              GRASS will start with the mapset defined by LOCATION  since  the
              LOCATION variable overrides the other variables.


       EExxaammppllee 22
              The environment variables are defined as follows:

              GISDBASE = /usr/local/grassData

              LOCATION_NAME = spearfish

              MAPSET = PERMANENT

              Start GRASS with the following command:

              grass5 -

              GRASS  will  start  with  the  mapset  defined by GISDBASE/LOCA-
              TION_NAME/MAPSET.


       EExxaammppllee 33
              The environment variables are defined as follows:

              LOCATION = /usr/local/grassData/spearfish/PERMANENT

              GISDBASE = /usr/local/grassData

              LOCATION_NAME = spearfish

              MAPSET = PERMANENT

              Start GRASS with the following command:

              grass5 /usr/home/grass/data/thailand/forests

              GRASS  will  start  with   the   mapset   /home/grass/data/thai-
              land/forests which overrides the environment variables.


       EExxaammppllee 44
              The environment variables are defined as follows:

              LOCATION = /usr/local/grassData/spearfish/PERMANENT

              GISDBASE = /usr/local/grassData

              LOCATION_NAME = spearfish

              MAPSET = PERMANENT

              Start GRASS with the following command:

              grass5 swamps

              GRASS  will  start  with  the  mapset  defined by GISDBASE/LOCA-
              TION_NAME/swamps since the command line argument for the  mapset
              overrides the environment variable MAPSET.


       EExxaammppllee 55
              The environment variables are defined as follows:

              LOCATION = /usr/local/grassData/spearfish/PERMANENT

              GISDBASE = /usr/local/grassData

              LOCATION_NAME = spearfish

              MAPSET = PERMANENT

              Start GRASS with the following command:

              grass5 thailand/forests

              GRASS  will  start  with  the  mapset  defined by GISDBASE/thai-
              land/forests since the command line arguments for  the  location
              and mapset overrides the environment variables LOCATION_NAME and
              MAPSET.

       Note that you will need to set these variables  using  the  appropriate
       method required for the UNIX shell that you use.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
       The following are some examples of how you could start GRASS

       ggrraassss55 Start  GRASS  using the default user interface. The user will be
              prompted to choose the appropriate location and mapset.

       ggrraassss55 --ttccllttkk
              Start GRASS using the Tcl/Tk based user interface. The user will
              be prompted to choose the appropriate location and mapset.

       ggrraassss55 --tteexxtt
              Start  GRASS  using the text based user interface. The user will
              be prompted to choose the appropriate location and mapset.

       ggrraassss55 --ttccllttkk --
              Start GRASS using the Tcl/Tk based user  interface  and  try  to
              obtain the location and mapset from environment variables.

       OOtthheerr eexxaammpplleess
              See the LLooccaattiioonn EEnnvviirroonnmmeenntt VVaarriiaabblleess section for further exam-

       If you start GRASS using the Tcl/Tk interface you must have a _w_i_s_h com-
       mand  in  your  $PATH variable. That is, the command must be named _w_i_s_h
       and not something like _w_i_s_h_8_._3. By default, a Tcl/Tk installation  does
       not  create  a _w_i_s_h command. Thus, the system administrator must create
       an appropriate link to the actual wish program.


       For  example,  suppose   Tcl/Tk   8.3   programs   are   installed   in
       /usr/local/bin.   Then  the  system  administrator  should  go  to  the
       /usr/local/bin directory and run the commands _l_n _-_s _w_i_s_h_8_._3 _w_i_s_h and _l_n
       _-_s _t_c_l_s_h_8_._3 _t_c_l_s_h to properly install Tcl/Tk for use with GRASS.


       Furthermore,  if  you  have  more than one version of Tcl/Tk installed,
       make sure that the version you want to use with GRASS is the first ver-
       sion  found  in your $PATH variable. GRASS searches your $PATH variable
       until it finds the first version of _w_i_s_h.
