       gg..sseettpprroojj  - Allows the user to create the PROJ_INFO and the PROJ_UNITS
       files to record the projection information associated  with  a  current
       location.

       Allows a user to create a PROJ_INFO file in the PERMANENT mapset of the
       current location. PROJ_INFO file  is  used  to  record  the  projection
       information associated with the specified mapset.

NNOOTTEESS
       User  running _g_._s_e_t_p_r_o_j must own PERMANENT mapset.  It is highly recom-
       mended to run _g_._s_e_t_p_r_o_j after creating a new location so  that  conver-
       sion programs (such as _v_._p_r_o_j) can be run.


       The current location must not contain a PROJ_INFO or PROJ_UNITS file.


       The user will be prompted for the projection name.


       The specification of any projection other than ll and stp will generate
       a request to the user for a name of a standard ellipse.


       The user will be asked for a map datum. If  no  map  datum  support  is
       needed,  the  question should be answered with no, so that no map datum
       is specified in the PROJ_INFO  file.   The  program  assures  that  the
       ellipsoid  matches  the  ellipsoid  defined with the map datum from the
       datum table within GRASS. If the map datum used is  not  listed  within
       this  program,  the user/administrator should add the definition to the
       systems datum.table.  If the ellipsoid specified does not match the one
       from  the  definition  in  the  datum  table, the program exits with an
       error.


       The projections of aea, lcc, merc, leae (GRASS 5.x), leac (GRASS  5.x),
       and  tmerc  will  generate a request to the user for the prime meridian
       and standard parallel for the output map.


       The projection of stp will generate a  request  to  the  user  for  the
       choice of zone for the output map.


       The  user will be prompted for the spheroid and zone of the UTM projec-
       tion.
