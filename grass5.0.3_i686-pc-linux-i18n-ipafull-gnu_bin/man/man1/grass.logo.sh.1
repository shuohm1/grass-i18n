       _g_r_a_s_s_._l_o_g_o_._s_h is primarily a demonstration of the GRASS _d_._g_r_a_p_h program
       in  a  UNIX  Bourne  shell  macro that generates the U.S. Army Corps of
       Engineers logo.  Users are encouraged  to  generate  their  own  unique
       logos  by writing similar macro shell scripts.  Examine the contents of
       the input file called _g_r_a_s_s_._l_o_g_o_._s_h located in the GRASS  shell  script
       command directory ($GISBASE/scripts) to see how the GRASS logo was gen-
       erated using _d_._g_r_a_p_h graphics commands.  The coordinates for this  logo
       were taken from a drawing done on graph paper.


       To  view the graphics described by this file use _d_._g_r_a_p_h or _d_._m_a_p_g_r_a_p_h,
       making sure that a copy of this file is either in your  current  direc-
       tory or is given by its full path name.

       _g_r_a_s_s_._l_o_g_o_._s_h,  like _d_._r_a_s_t, will overwrite (not overlay) whatever dis-
       play appears in the active graphics frame.


       This program requires no command line arguments.
