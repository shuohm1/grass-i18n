       The  GRASS  program  _v_._d_i_g_i_t  is  a menu-driven, highly interactive map
       development program used for inputting analog map  data  into  a  GRASS
       vector  format.  _v_._d_i_g_i_t contains programs for vector digitizing, edit-
       ing, labeling, windowing, and converting vector data  to  GRASS  raster
       format.


       _v_._d_i_g_i_t  consists of two parts: an initialization procedure, and a mul-
       tiple menu-driven environment.

              The initialization  procedure  involves  choosing  a  digitizer,
              choosing  the  name  of  a vector map layer to digitize, and, if
              needed, registering a map  to  the  digitizing  surface.  It  is
              important to specify the map scale.

              The  second  part  of  _v_._d_i_g_i_t is a multiple-menu environment in
              which digitizing,  editing,  labeling,  and  other  options  are
              available.  It is within this second portion of _v_._d_i_g_i_t that all
              vector creation occurs.

       _v_._d_i_g_i_t was written to optimize digitizing speed and  performance.   It
       has  a  convenient graphic display format and very convenient windowing
       capabilities. Features are color-coded for ease of  identification  and
       verification.   Different color schemes may be user-chosen to customize
       a digitizing session.


       Area, line, and point features may be digitized in  both  "stream"  and
       "point" modes. Both a mouse and a digitizer may be used to perform win-
       dowing functions.  Labeling and editing are done from  within  _v_._d_i_g_i_t,
       rather than through a separate set of programs.


       _v_._d_i_g_i_t  has  capabilities  that  allow users to display raster maps in
       background (Customize menu, Backdrop), to overlay already existing vec-
       tor  map layers onto the feature being digitized (Customize menu, Over-
       lay), and set a multitude of parameters to furtherly customize a  digi-
       tizing session.


       _v_._d_i_g_i_t  may  be  used  with  or without a digitizer.  Many options are
       available if no digitizer is used, i.e. digitizer support by mouse.


       All options available within _v_._d_i_g_i_t are contained  within  ten  menus.
       Movement  from  menu  to  menu  is done by chosing the movement options
       specified at the bottom of each menu.

       GRASS is using device  independent  code  written  originally  by  John
       Dabritz  formerly  of  the Forest Service, which uses ascii description
       files to define how to communicate with the digitizer.  The  result  is
       that  we  should  be able to support just about any digitizer out there
       now with a minimum of work.  Refer to the "digitizer definition manual"
       for information on the format of these files.
