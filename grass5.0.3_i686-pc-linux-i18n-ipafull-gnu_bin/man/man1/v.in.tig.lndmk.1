DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       This program creates a GRASS site or vector map  of  Census  "Landmark"
       features  in  the  current mapset (UTM or Lat-Long locations only) with
       labelled points,  areas  or  lines  constructed  from  the  TIGER  file
       records.   Each  point  or  area  Landmark  is  a  record in the Type 7
       TIGER/Line file for a county.


       The user may select the Landmark Features to include in the new map  by
       specifying  CFCC's (Census Feature Classification Code), or by specify-
       ing text string(s) to match  with  the  Landmark  Feature  Name  field.
       [Many  Landmark records do not have an entry in the Feature Name field,
       so use the string matching selection with care.]


       Point Landmarks are generated only from information in the Type 7 file.
       Area  Landmarks,  which  often  comprise  several individually labelled
       polygons, are generated from data in TIGER file Types 7, 8, I, P, 1 and
       2 (in order of use).


       When  making  "line"  maps, this program functions as a selection front
       end to the _v_._i_n_._t_i_g_._b_a_s_i_c
        program; see that programs documentation for the  information  on  how
       these line maps will be labelled.


       TIGER/Line files from multiple counties should not be mixed or concate-
       nated when using this program.


       The program should function well independent of the termination charac-
       ter(s)  at  the end of each line in the input files.  , , neither, one,
       or both are acceptable.  Different distribution media  apparently  have
       different record delimiting characters.

       Note:  Always use the ..ssttrriinnggss, ..mmaattcchhbbootthh and/or ..ccooddeess commands prior
       to creating a map with ..ppooiinnttss, ..aarreeaass or ..lliinneess.


       ..ppooiinnttss  mmaappnnaammee  begins  the  process of making a GRASS4.1 site map of
       point  locations.   This  site  map  name  takes  precedence  over  the
       site=name parameter that may be given on the command line.


       Specification of the CFCC's, if any, for the features you want included
       in the map should be done on the line(s) following ..ppooiinnttss  and  should
       conclude  with  a line containing ..eenndd, which begins the map generation
       process.  The CFCC's should be of the form Dnn (_e_._g_., D00;  D10  D85  |
       D23,  H12);  several  may be given on one line, separated by any common
       separator character.  Requested CFCC's may be abbreviated to D1  (mean-
       ing D10 through D19) or just D (meaning D00 through D99).


       If  matching  text  strings are desired (see _._s_t_r_i_n_g_s_'_f_R_)_, _t_h_e_y _m_u_s_t _b_e

       ..aarreeaass mmaappnnaammee begins the process of making a GRASS4.1  vector  map  of
       polygons  (areas).   This  vector  map  name  takes precedence over the
       vect=name parameter that may be given on the command line.   Specifica-
       tion  of  the CFCC's, if any, for the features you want included in the
       map should be done on the line(s) following ..aarreeaass and should  conclude
       with a line containing ..eenndd, which begins the map generation process.


       If  matching  text  strings are desired (see _._s_t_r_i_n_g_s_'_f_R_)_, _t_h_e_y _m_u_s_t _b_e

       ..lliinneess mmaappnnaammee begins the process of making a GRASS4.1  vector  map  of
       lines.   This  option  uses  only  the  Type  1  and 2 TIGER files.  It
       searches the Type 1 records for the specified CFCC's  and  matches  any
       specified text strings to the Feature Name (FENAME) field in the Type 1
       records.  Specification of the CFCC's, if any,  for  the  features  you
       want included in the map should be done on the line(s) following ..aarreeaass
       and should conclude with a line containing ..eenndd, which begins  the  map
       generation process.


       If  matching  text  strings are desired (see _._s_t_r_i_n_g_s_'_f_R_)_, _t_h_e_y _m_u_s_t _b_e

       ..ccooddeess searches the Type 7 Landmark file and sends to stdout, or  to  a
       file  if  one specified, the CFCC and the Classification description of
       each CFCC present.  If a 'P' or 'A' is specified, both  the  point  and
       area  codes  present are listed.  'L' lists the CFCC codes contained in
       the Type 1 file.  The default type, if no type is  specified,  is  'P'.
       This command is provided as a useful aid to the user.


       ..ssttrriinnggss  records  up  to  10  following  lines  (until ".end") as text
       strings to match to the Landmark Feature  Name  Field  in  the  Type  7
       records  (Type  1  for making ".line" maps).  A match is made if any of
       the specfied strings is a _s_u_b_s_t_r_i_n_g of the Feature Name.  If exact case
       matching  is required, '!' should be the first character of the entered
       text strings.  Example:  The Feature Name "Walter Reed  Army  Hospital"
       would be matched by any of the following strings.
         !Walt
         hosp
         Reed
         army hosp

       If the optional filename parameter is given, Type 7 records which match
       the specified strings are reported to that  file,  otherwise  they  are
       reported to stdout.


       ..mmaattcchhbbootthh  is used to specify that a Landmark record (or Type 1 record
       for ".lines") must match both one of the specified CFCC's  _a_n_d  one  of
       the specified text strings to be selected.  A match to _e_i_t_h_e_r condition
       is the default mode, and can be explicitly set or reset by the optional
       "no" parameter; _i_._e_., ..mmaattcchhbbootthh nnoo.


       ..eexxiitt is used to exit from the program.

       GRASS IMPORT FROM CENSUS LANDMARK FEATURE RECORDS


       STEP 1:  Select Type(s) of features to be extracted
          There are Point and Area (polygon) Landmark feature types.
            in the Landmark (Type 7) Records

          There may also be some Line (vector) Landmark features
            in the Basic Data (Type 1) Records

          Mark one feature type you wish extracted:

                          Point   x
                          Area    _
                          Line    _

          View CFCC Codes for selected type  x

          or  Exit program  _

              AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT <ESC> TO CONTINUE
                            (OR <Ctrl-C> TO CANCEL)

       Comments:   This is the "Main Menu."  You must select (by entering 'x')
       oonnee of the Point, Area or Line choices.  The viewing of the CFCC  codes
       is optional, but is usually done initially.


       The  following  screen  results from a request to View CFCC Codes after
       selecting Point features:
            TIGER Type 7 file <tgr53037.f47>

                           (OR <Ctrl-C> TO CANCEL)

       Comments:   You  may request to see the list on the screen, or have the
       list sent to a file in your home directory, or both.   If  you  request
       neither,  the  program  returns  to the Main Menu.  Both point and area
       landmarks are reported if either "Point" or "Area" was selected on  the
       Main  Menu.   If  "Line"  was  requested on the Main Menu, all the CFCC
       codes in the Type 1 (Basic Data Record) file will  be  tabulated  (this
       can  be  a useful product for other purposes); remember that the Type 1
       file is large and this processing may take a few minutes or more.


       The following is typical output of CFCC Codes:

       Some  area features are included in the Type 7 (Landmark) file which do
       not fit the definition given of "Landmark" (CFCC's beginning with 'D'),
       as  a  mechanism  to  have  them included in the Tiger/Line data.  Many
       Hydrography area features fall in  this  category  for  some  counties.
       Also, there may be records in both the Type 1 and Type 7 files for some
       Landmark features, such as airports, and to make a complete airport map
       for a county both sets must be extracted.


       In  the  first  trials  of  this  program  is  was  discovered that the
       TIGER/Line files have several defects in topological completeness  when
       area  landmark  polygons are created.  These defects express themselves
       when v.support is run (automatically) to attach labels to the  polygons
       and  is  unable  to attach one or more label points.  Some editing with
       v.digit should be able to resolve these problems.


       CCaauuttiioonn:: This program will overwrite an existing vector map of the same
       name without warning.  Site_list maps will not be overwritten.


       Since this program opens many TIGER files at once, the set for a county
       must reside on a disk or CD-ROM, not tape.  Only file types 1, 2, 7, 8,
       I  and  P  are  used so only those would have to be copied from tape to
       disk.
