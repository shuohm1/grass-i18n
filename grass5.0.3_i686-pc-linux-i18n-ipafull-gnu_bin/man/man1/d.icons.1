       _d_._i_c_o_n_s graphically displays point (site) locations  as  icons  in  the
       active  frame on the graphics monitor.  Geographic coordinates are read
       either from standard input or from an input file whose name  is  stated
       by  the user.  At each site location, a user-defined icon is displayed.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       The user must enter at least the name of an _i_c_o_n file storing a graphic
       representation  of the icon to be displayed, and the geographic coordi-
       nates of the points at which they will appear.


       The user can run this  program  either  non-interactively  or  interac-
       tively.   The  program will be run non-interactively if the user speci-
       fies the name of an _i_c_o_n file and (optionally) any other desired param-
       eters  on  the  command  line,  using  the form: dd..iiccoonnss [--rr] iiccoonn==_n_a_m_e
       [ccoolloorr==_n_a_m_e] [ssiizzee==_v_a_l_u_e] [ppooiinnttss==_n_a_m_e]

       If the user fails to specify the name of a _p_o_i_n_t_s file on  the  command
       line,  the program will prompt the user to enter geographic coordinates
       from standard input.  If the user specifies at least  the  name  of  an
       _i_c_o_n file on the command line, any other parameter values left unspeci-
       fied by the user will be set to their default values (see below).


       Alternately, the user can simply type: dd..iiccoonnss

       on the command line, without program arguments.  In this case, the user
       will  be  prompted for needed parameter values using the standard GRASS
       user interface described in the manual  entry  for  _p_a_r_s_e_r.   The  geo-
       graphic  coordinates  at  which  icons are to be displayed can still be
       input from an input file (_p_o_i_n_t_s) in interactive use.

   FFllaagg::
       --rr     Coordinates are input in reverse order (i.e., as _n_o_r_t_h_i_n_g  _e_a_s_t_-
              _i_n_g).


   PPaarraammeetteerrss::
       iiccoonn==_n_a_m_e
              The name of an existing file containing a graphic representation
              of the icon to be drawn.  _i_c_o_n files can be created by the  user
              using  the _p_._i_c_o_n_s command and are stored under the _i_c_o_n_s direc-
              tory under the user's current mapset.

       ccoolloorr==_n_a_m_e
              Sets the current icon color to the _n_a_m_e stated.
              Options: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, gray,
              white, and black
              Default: white

       ssiizzee==_v_a_l_u_e
              The icon scaling factor.
              Options: 1-1000
              Default: 1

       ppooiinnttss==_n_a_m_e
              The name of a UNIX file containing the geographic coordinates of
              sites at which icons are to be drawn.   Since  this  is  a  UNIX
              file,  the user should specify the name using standard UNIX file
              naming conventions.  If this file is not in the  user's  current
              working  directory,  its pathname should be specified.  The file
              contents should consist of a series  of  geographic  coordinates
              that  fall  within  the  boundaries  of  the  current geographic
              region.  Each site location should be stated on a separate  line
              as an easting and northing (in that order) separated by a single
              blank space.  If no _p_o_i_n_t_s file is specified by the user,  input
              is  taken  from  standard  input and should be given in the same
              form; to end standard input, type _e_n_d (or press control-d).


EEXXAAMMPPLLEE
       An _i_c_o_n_s file contains a graphic representation of the icon to be  dis-
       played.  Here,  spaces  represent  areas of no color, and x's represent
       areas of color. For example, the user might construct  an  icon  resem-
       bling a cross in the following way:
         x
         x
       xxxxx
         x
         x
         x


       This  icon  might  be  stored  in a file called _c_r_o_s_s (under the user's
       $LOCATION/icons directory). If the user specified that this be the _i_c_o_n
       file  used  while  running _d_._i_c_o_n_s, this cross would then appear in the
       _c_o_l_o_r and _s_i_z_e specified by the user, at each site  location  named  in
       the _p_o_i_n_t_s file.


       Note: icons are created with the _p_._i_c_o_n_s command.


       The  _p_o_i_n_t_s file lists the geographic coordinates of site locations (at
       which icons will be displayed). This file should take the form:
       easting northing
       easting northing
       easting northing


       If the user sets the --rr flag, the order of these coordinates should  be
       reversed (i.e., coordinates should be given as _n_o_r_t_h_i_n_g _e_a_s_t_i_n_g).


       If the points file is not specified, then the corrdinates are read from
       the keyboard or across a pipe. This feature allows users to  enter  the
       coordinates  by  hand, or, more usefully, to get then from another pro-
       gram. For example, to display icons at locations specified in  a  sites
       list: ss..oouutt..aasscciiii _n_a_m_e | dd..iiccoonnss iiccoonn==_c_r_o_s_s

       where  _n_a_m_e  is  the  name  of a site list, and _c_r_o_s_s is the name of an
       icon.
