       Aerial  photographs  may  be  either vertical or oblique. Vertical pho-
       tographs can be truly vertical (nadir), or slightly tilted (less than 3
       degree  from  the  vertical).  Usually aerial photos are tilted to some
       degree. We refer to the term _v_e_r_t_i_c_a_l _p_h_o_t_o_g_r_a_p_h up  to  a  tilt  of  3
       degree.
       Oblique  aerial photographs are purposely taken with an angle between 3
       and 90 degree from the nadir direction.


       TThhee uussee ooff _p_h_o_t_o_._i_n_i_t (menu 6)  is  only  required  when  rectifying  a
       tilted or oblique aerial photo.


       _p_h_o_t_o_._i_n_i_t  creates  or  modifies  entries in a camera initial exposure
       station file for  imagery  group  referenced  by  a  sub-block.   These
       entries include: the (XC,YC,ZC) positional (e.g. UTM) approximate coor-
       dinates of the camera exposure station; initial roll,  pitch,  and  yaw
       angles  (in degrees) of the cameras attitude; and the _a _p_r_i_o_r_i standard
       deviations  for  these  parameters.   During   the   imagery   program,
       photo.rectify,  the  initial  camera  exposure station file is used for
       computation of the ortho-rectification parameters.  If no initial  cam-
       era  exposure  station file exist, the default values are computed from
       the control points file created in _p_h_o_t_o_._2_t_a_r_g_e_t .

       The INITIAL values for (XC,YC,ZC) are expressed in standard (e.g.  UTM)
       coordinates,  and  represent  an  approximation for the location of the
       camera at the time of exposure.

                      X: East aircraft position;

                      Y: North aircraft position;

                      Z: Flight altitude above sea level


       The INITIAL values for (omega,phi,kappa) are expressed in degrees,  and
       represent  an  approximation  for  the cameras attitude  at the time of
       exposure.

                      Omega (roll): Raising or lowering of the wings  (turning
                     around the aircraft's axis);

                      Phi (pitch): Raising or lowering of the aircraft's front
                     (turning around the wings' axis);

                      Kappa (yaw): Rotation needed to align the  aerial  photo
                     to  true  north:  needs  to  be denoted as +90 degree for
                     clockwise turn and  -90  degree  for  a  counterclockwise
                     turn.


       The standard deviations for (XC,YC,ZC) are expressed in meters, and are
       used as _a _p_r_i_o_r_i values for the standard deviations used in computation
       of the ortho rectification parameters.


       The standard deviations for (omega,phi,kappa) are expressed in degrees,
       and are used as _a _p_r_i_o_r_i values for the  standard  deviations  used  in
       computation of the ortho rectification parameters.
