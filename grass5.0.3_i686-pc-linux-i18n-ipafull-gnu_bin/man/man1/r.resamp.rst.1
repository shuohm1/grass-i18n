       _r_._r_e_s_a_m_p_._r_s_t

       This program reinterpolates the values a from given raster  file  named
       _i_n_p_u_t  to  a  new  raster file named _e_l_e_v. If _-_r flag is specified, all
       zero elevations in _i_n_p_u_t file are treated as elevations, otherwise they
       are  ignored.  Reinterpolation  (resampling) is done to higher, same or
       lower resolution which is specified by parameters  _e_w___r_e_s  and  _n_s___r_e_s.
       All  resulting  raster  files  are  created for the given region (which
       might be different from the header of the input raster  file).   As  an
       option,   simultaneously  with  interpolation,  topographic  parameters
       slope, aspect, profile curvature (measured in the direction of steepest
       slope), tangential curvature (measured in the direction of a tangent to
       contour line) or mean curvature are computed and saved as raster  files
       as  specified by the options _s_l_o_p_e_, _a_s_p_e_c_t_, _p_c_u_r_v_, _t_c_u_r_v_, _m_c_u_r_v respec-
       tively.  If _-_d flag is set  the  program  outputs  partial  derivatives
       fx,fy,fxx, fxy,fyy instead of slope, aspect and curvatures.

       For  noisy  data, it is possible to define spatially variable smoothing
       by prividing a raster  file  _s_m_o_o_t_h  containing  smoothing  parameters.
       With  the  smoothing parameter set to zero (_s_m_o_o_t_h is not given or con-
       tains zero data), the resulting surface passes exactly through the data
       points. User can define a raster file named _m_a_s_k_m_a_p, which will be used
       as a mask. The interpolation is skipped for cells which have zero value
       in  mask.  Zero  values  will  be assigned to these cells in all output
       raster files. Parameter _z_m_u_l_t allows the user to rescale  the  z-values
       (useful,  e.g.,  for  transformation  of  elevations  given  in feet to
       meters, so that the proper values of slopes and curvatures can be  com-
       puted).

       Regularized spline with tension is used for the interpolation. The _t_e_n_-
       _s_i_o_n parameter tunes the character of the resulting surface  from  thin
       plate  to membrane. Higher values of tension parameter reduce the over-
       shoots that can appear in surfaces with rapid change of  gradient.  The
       flag  _-_t  can be set to use "dnorm independent tension". The interpola-
       tion is performed for overlaping rectangular  segments.  The  user  can
       define the width of overlap (in number of cells) by option _o_v_e_r_l_a_p.

       The  user  can  run  this  program either interactively or non-interac-
       tively.   The  program  will  be  run  non-interactively  if  the  user
       specifies program arguments and flag settings on the command line using
       the form:

       rr..rreessaammpp..rrsstt [[--rr]] [[--dd]] [[--tt]] iinnppuutt = name eeww__rreess = val nnss__rreess = val eelleevv

       Alternatively,  the  user  can simply type  rr..rreessaammpp..rrsstt on the command
       line without program arguments. In this case, the user will be prompted
       for  parameter values and flag settings using the standard GRASS parser
       interface described in the manual entry for _p_a_r_s_e_r .

NNOOTTEESS
       _r_._r_e_s_a_m_p_._r_s_t uses regularized spline with tension for interpolation (as
       described in Mitasova and Mitas, 1993). Region is  temporarily  changed
       while writing output files with desired resolution. Topographic parame-
       ters are computed the same way as in s.surf.rst. (See also Mitasova and
       Hofierka,  1993)  Raster  file _s_m_o_o_t_h should contain variable smoothing
       parameters that can be derived from errors, slope, etc.  using   _r_._m_a_p_-
       _c_a_l_c.  The program gives warning when significant overshoots appear and
       higher tension should be used.  However,  with  tension  too  high  the
       resulting  surface  changes  its  behavior  to  membrane  (rubber sheet
       stretched over the data points resulting in a peak or pit in each given
       point and everywhere else the surface goes rapidly to trend). Smoothing
       can also be used to reduce the overshoots. When overshoots  occure  the
       resulting  _e_l_e_v  file  will  have white color in the locations of over-
       shoots since the color table for the output file is the  same  as  col-
       ortable  for raster input file.The program checks the numerical stabil-
       ity of the algorithm by computation of  values  in  given  points,  and
       prints the maximum difference found into the history file of raster map
       _e_l_e_v . Increase in tension is suggested if the difference is  unaccept-
       able. For computation with smoothing set to 0 this difference should be
       0. With smoothing parameter greater than zero the surface will not pass
       through  the  data  points  and the higher the parameter the closer the
       surface will be to the trend.

       The program writes the values of parameters used  in  computation  into
       the comment part of the history file _e_l_e_v as well as the following val-
       ues which help to evaluate the results and choose the suitable  parame-
       ters:  minimum  and  maximum  z  values  in  the  data file (zmin_data,
       zmax_data) and in the interpolated  raster  map  (zmin_int,  zmax_int),
       maximum  difference  between  the  given  and interpolated z value in a
       given point (errtotal),  rescaling  parameter  used  for  normalization
       (dnorm),  which  influences the tension. The program gives warning when
       the user wants to interpolate outside the region given by the header of
       the  input  raster  file, zooming into the area where the points are is
       suggested in this case. When a mask is  used,  the  program  takes  all
       points  in  the  given region for interpolation, including those in the
       area which is masked out, to ensure proper interpolation along the bor-
       der  of  the  mask.  It therefore does not mask out the data points; if
       this is desirable, it must be done outside _r_._r_e_s_a_m_p_._r_s_t .
