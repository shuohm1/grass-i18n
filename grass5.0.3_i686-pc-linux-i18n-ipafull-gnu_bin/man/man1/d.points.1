       _d_._p_o_i_n_t_s displays points whose coordinate locations  are  specified  by
       the user and located within the current geographic region in the active
       display frame on the graphics  monitor.   Point  coordinates  are  read
       either  from  standard  input  or  from  a file stated by the ffiillee==_n_a_m_e
       option. When entering coordinates  through  standard  input,  the  user
       presses _c_o_n_t_r_o_l_-_d to signal the end of input to _d_._p_o_i_n_t_s.

       The  program  can  be run interactively or non-interactively.  The user
       can run the program completely non-interactively by specifying the name
       of  a points ffiillee (containing the geographic coordinates of icons to be
       sited) and the values of all needed parameters on the command line.  If
       the name of an input ffiillee to _d_._p_o_i_n_t_s is given on the command line, any
       other parameter values left unspecified on the command line (e.g.,  the
       icon ccoolloorr, ssiizzee, and/or ttyyppee) are set to their default values.


       The  user can instead elect to run the program partially interactively,
       by specifying any/all of the parameters  _e_x_c_e_p_t  the  points  ffiillee==_n_a_m_e
       parameter  on the command line.  In this case, _d_._p_o_i_n_t_s will expect the
       user to enter icon locations from standard input  (i.e.,  at  the  key-
       board) and will prompt the user for these locations. Each icon location
       should be entered as an easting and northing pair separated by a space,
       followed  by  a carriage return.  Coordinates should be stated in what-
       ever map coordinate system is used by the user's  current  GRASS  loca-
       tion.   The  user presses _c_o_n_t_r_o_l_-_d to signal the end of standard input
       to _d_._p_o_i_n_t_s.


       Alternately, the user can simply type dd..ppooiinnttss on the command line, and
       be  prompted for the values of all parameters (the user can still input
       icon coordinates from an input file using this form). In this case, the
       user is presented with the standard GRASS _p_a_r_s_e_r interface.

       ccoolloorr==_n_a_m_e
              Sets the current color to the _n_a_m_e stated.
              Options: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, gray,
              white, and black
              Default: _g_r_a_y

       ssiizzee==_v_a_l_u_e
              Size of icon in pixels.
              Options: 0-1000 (pixels)
              Default: 5 (pixels)

       ttyyppee==_n_a_m_e
              Sets the shape (type) of the icon to be drawn to _n_a_m_e.
              Options: x, diamond, box, +
              Default: +

       ffiillee==_n_a_m_e
              Take input from the UNIX file _n_a_m_e.  (Note: This file must be in
              the user's current directory or given by its full path name.)
              Default: Standard input.
              The file contents should consist of a series of geographic coor-
              dinates that fit within the boundaries of the current geographic
              region falling within the active display frame (refer to _d_._w_h_e_r_e
              or _g_._r_e_g_i_o_n for these coordinates).  Each icon  location  should
              be  specified  by  an easting and northing (in that order) sepa-
              rated by a single  blank  space,  and  followed  by  a  carriage
              return.  Eastings and northings should be stated in whatever map
              coordinate system is being used  by  the  user's  current  GRASS
              location.

       _d_._p_o_i_n_t_s  will  display a point at the location specified in the active
       frame, even if the point lies outside the boundaries  of  current  geo-
       graphic region.
