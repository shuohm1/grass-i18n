DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN _v_._i_n_f_o reports some basic information about a
       user-specified vector map layer and  the  topology  status.   This  map
       layer must exist in the user's current mapset search path.  Information
       about the map's boundaries, projection, data type,  topology  presence,
       category number, number of lines, areas and islands, data base location
       and mapset, and history are put into a table and  written  to  standard
       output.  The types of information listed can also be found in the cats,
       cellhd, and hist directories under the mapset in which the named map is
       stored.


       The  program  will  be  run non-interactively if the user specifies the
       name of a vector map layer on the command line, using the form:


       _v_._i_n_f_o _i_n_p_u_t_=_n_a_m_e


       where _i_n_p_u_t is the name of a vector map layer on which the  user  seeks
       information.   The  user can save the tabular output to a file by using
       the UNIX redirection mechanism (>); for example, the user might save  a
       report  on the _s_t_r_e_a_m_s map layer in a file called _s_t_r_e_a_m_._r_p_t by typing:
       rr..iinnffoo iinnppuutt==_s_t_r_e_a_m_s > _s_t_r_e_a_m_._r_p_t

       Alternately, the user can simply type _v_._i_n_f_o on the command line, with-
       out  program arguments. In this case, the user will be prompted for the
       name of a vector map layer using the standard GRASS  _p_a_r_s_e_r  interface.
       The  user is asked whether he wishes to print the report and/or save it
       in a file.  If saved, the report is stored in a user-named file in  the
       user's home directory.
