       A  Stage III precipitation product is a mosaic of all the Stage II pre-
       cipitation estimates within the RFC (River Forecast Center) area.   The
       Stage  III  products  are produced by merging radar precipitation esti-
       mates (Stage I) with ground truth data provided by rain gages.  In  the
       Arkansas-red River Forecast Center (ABRFC) this includes 15 88-D radars
       and approximately 500 rain gages.   The  13  RFC's  within  the  United
       States  will  eventually  produce  Stage  III products.  As of 4-94 the
       ABRFC is the only RFC currently producing Stage III products.  As  more
       radars  come  on  line other RFC's will begin producing this product as
       well.  The 88-D radars have difficulty detecting precipitation when the
       raindrops  are  very  small or when the precipitation is in the form of
       snow.  Under these conditions precipitation estimates tend to be  under
       estimated.  Large Hail within a storm causes the radar to over estimate
       precipitation amounts.  The grid cell size is approximately 4 km  by  4
       km.   The NetCDF files containing the precipitation values in the units
       of 1/100 of mm can be obtained from ABRFC's  gopher  server.   _r_._s_t_a_g_e_3
       program generates the GRASS raster map layers only in the Lat/Lon coor-
       dinate system.  UTM is not utilized because the area  being  referenced
       is  too large for a UTM zone.  The region settings for the ABRFC's cov-
       erage area is:
        __________________________________________
        projection: 3 (Latitude-Longitude)
        zone:  0
        north: 41:16:06N
        south: 32:48:28N

       You may use the clark66 spheroid and use any  resolution  that  may  be
       suitable  as  far as your other data requirements are concerned. (start
       with esres= nsres = 0:00:30).


       This version of _r_._s_t_a_g_e_3 will work only on NetCDF files  created  after
       the 6th of April 1994.


       You  will need the NetCDF libraries created by the Unidata Program Cen-
       ter.  The NetCDF libraries can  be  obtained  via  anonymous  ftp  from
       unidata.ucar.edu  under  pub/netcdf/netcdf.tar.Z.  You will the need to
       compile  the  libraries.   _r_._s_t_a_g_e_3  can  be  only  run  within  GRASS.
       _r_._s_t_a_g_e_3  needs  both  the  NetCDF  libraries  as  well  as  the  GRASS
       libraries.  If you have all the libraries then _r_._s_t_a_g_e_3 can be compiled
       simply by running "gmake" (For GRASS 4.2 it is gmake4.2) in this direc-
       tory.


       In the above, if the output parameter is not specified then  a  mapname
       with  the  same  name  as  that of the input parameter is created.  The
       rainbow colortable is created for the  resultant  map.   The  resulting
       maps have a resolution of 0:02:59.


       A  few sample NetCDF files and the corresponding GIF files are provided
       in the sample directory.  The  vector  directory  contains  the  vector
       boundary output from the command _v_._o_u_t_._a_s_c_i_i of the ABRFC basin.


       To  run  _r_._s_t_a_g_e_3 on the sample files just go into the sample directory
       and type:


       _r_._s_t_a_g_e_3 _-_v _i_n_=_0_4_0_5_9_4_1_8_._n_c


       This will create a raster  map  by  the  name  04059418.nc.   Similarly
       _r_._s_t_a_g_e_3  can be run on other sample files. You can use the correspond-
       ing GIF files to compare them.  Since the GIF files are in a  different
       projection  system, there is some distortion in between the raster maps
       and the GIF file.  However the values in the raster are  properly  geo-
       referenced.
