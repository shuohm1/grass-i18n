       The  _r_._m_a_s_k program allows the user to block out certain areas of a map
       from analysis, by "hiding" them from sight  of  other  GRASS  programs.
       This  is  done by establishing a mask.  While a mask exists, most GRASS
       programs will operate only on data falling inside the masked area,  and
       ignore any data falling outside of the mask.


       Because  the mask is actually only a reclass file called "MASK" that is
       created when the user identifies a mask using _r_._m_a_s_k, it can be copied,
       renamed,  removed,  and  used in analyses, just like other GRASS raster
       map layers.  The user should be aware that  a  mask  remains  in  place
       until  a  user renames it to something other than "MASK", or removes it
       using _r_._m_a_s_k or _g_._r_e_m_o_v_e.


       _r_._m_a_s_k provides the following options:
             1 Remove the current mask
             2 Identify a new mask
            RETURN Exit from program

       The user establishes a new mask by choosing option (2).  The user  will
       be  asked  to name an existing raster map layer from among those avail-
       able in the current mapset search path.  Once done, the user is shown a
       listing of this map's categories, and is asked to assign a value of "1"
       or "0" to each map category.  Areas assigned category  value  "1"  will
       become  part of the mask's surface, while areas assigned category value
       "0" will become "no data" areas in the MASK file.


       If a category is not assigned category value "1" it will  automatically
       be  assigned  the  category  value "0" in the resulting MASK file.  Any
       cells falling in category "0" will fall outside the newly formed  mask,
       and  their  presence will be ignored by GRASS programs run later on, as
       long as the MASK file remains in place.

NNOOTTEESS
       The above method for specifying a  "mask"  may  seem  counterintuitive.
       Areas  inside  the  mask are not hidden; areas outside the mask will be
       ignored until the MASK file is removed.


       This program actually creates a raster map layer (reclass type)  called
       _M_A_S_K,  which  can  be manipulated (renamed, removed, copied, etc.) like
       any other raster map layer.


       Somewhat similar program functions to those performed by _r_._m_a_s_k can  be
       done using _r_._m_a_p_c_a_l_c, _g_._r_e_g_i_o_n, and other programs.


       This program can only be run interactively.


       Note that some programs, like _r_._s_t_a_t_s, have options that allow the user
       to see the effects of the current mask  without  removing  the  current
       mask. See, for example, use of the --mm option for _r_._s_t_a_t_s.
