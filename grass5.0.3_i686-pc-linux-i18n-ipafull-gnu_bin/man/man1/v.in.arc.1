       The user may wish to use GRASS programs on data files that were created
       by other GISs.  To do this, the user must first convert data  files  in
       these  systems'  formats  to  GRASS's  file format.  Bringing data from
       other systems into GRASS is termed file  _i_m_p_o_r_t.   Sending  GRASS  data
       files out into other systems' formats is termed file _e_x_p_o_r_t.


       A variety of GRASS programs exist to import and export data to and from
       GRASS.  The _v_._i_n_._a_r_c program will convert  vector  data  in  ARC/INFO's
       "Generate"  format to GRASS's vector file format, and bring it into the
       user's current GRASS mapset.  The files to be imported  to  GRASS  must
       first  have  been  exported from ARC/INFO using the ARC/INFO _U_n_g_e_n_e_r_a_t_e
       command, and may represent either linear features ("line coverage")  or
       areal   features  ("polygon  coverage").   The  _A_R_C_/_I_N_F_O  _U_s_e_r_'_s  _G_u_i_d_e
       describes how files containing linear and  polygonal  features  can  be
       exported  from ARC/INFO, in a section detailing the use of the _U_n_g_e_n_e_r_-
       _a_t_e command.


       NNoottee 11::  The ARC coverage must be set to single precision  before  run-
       ning  _U_n_g_e_n_e_r_a_t_e.  If it is not, first copy it to another coverage that
       is set to single precision, then run _U_n_g_e_n_e_r_a_t_e.


       NNoottee 22::  To use for text attributes, numeric fields  with  values  >999
       may  contain  no  commas or TABs.  Also, the first record must have all
       fields filled.

       Program parameters and the flag have the following meanings.



   FFllaaggss::
       --nn     Neatline.  Vectors representing  a  box  (neatline)  around  the

              GRASS attribute column in label-text file.  Number of label-text
              column containing attribute text.



       This program can be run either non-interactively or interactively.  The
       program will run non-interactively if the user specifies the (optional)
       flag setting and needed parameter values on the command line, using the
       form:


       vv..iinn..aarrcc  [--nn]  ttyyppee==_n_a_m_e lliinneess__iinn==_n_a_m_e [ppooiinnttss__iinn==_n_a_m_e] [tteexxtt__iinn==_n_a_m_e]
       vveeccttoorr__oouutt==_n_a_m_e [iiddccooll==_v_a_l_u_e] [ccaattccooll==_v_a_l_u_e] [aattttccooll==_v_a_l_u_e]





       Alternately, the user can type:


       vv..iinn..aarrcc



       on the command line without program arguments;  in this case, the  pro-
       gram  will prompt the user for the flag setting and parameter values in
       the manner shown below.




       In ARC/INFO, three files are used to store polygon data:


       1) a _l_i_n_e_s _f_i_l_e, which contains coordinates of all the area edge lines;
       2) a _l_a_b_e_l_-_p_o_i_n_t _f_i_l_e, which contains coordinates of label-points (each
       of which has associated with it a unique label-point ID  number).   One
       label-point  is associated with each polygon defined in the _l_i_n_e_s _f_i_l_e;
       3) a _l_a_b_e_l_-_t_e_x_t _f_i_l_e, which associates each label-point ID number  with
       a category number and category ("attribute") text.

       Linear  feature  data  are  stored in two files: 1) a _l_i_n_e_s _f_i_l_e, which
       contains geographic coordinates defining lines,  each  with  a  line-ID
       number;  and 2) a _l_a_b_e_l_-_t_e_x_t _f_i_l_e, which associates each line-ID number
       with a category number and attribute text.




       These data files are described in further detail below, under the  DATA
       FILE FORMATS section.

IINNTTEERRAACCTTIIVVEE MMOODDEE
       The  program  will  prompt  the user for the flag setting and parameter
       values if the user does not specify these on the command line.   First,
       the  user  will  be  asked to assign a name to the vector file to store
       program output:
            VECTOR (DIGIT) FILENAME
            Enter 'list' for a list of existing binary vector files
            Hit RETURN to cancel request
            >

       Next, the user is asked to specify the COVERAGE (feature)  type  to  be
       imported into GRASS.  Valid coverage types are ppoollyyggoonn and lliinnee.
            COVERAGE TYPE
            Enter "polygon" or "line"
            Hit RETURN to cancel request
            >

       IMPORTING A POLYGON COVERAGE


       If  the user chooses POLYGON coverage, he is asked if he wishes a neat-
       line placed around his data.  (The existence of neatlines in the output
       file can facilitate subsequent patching of data files.)
            NEATLINE
            Do you want a neatline ?
            Enter "yes" or "no"
            >

       If  the user types yyeess, vectors that box the data will be inserted into
       the GRASS vector output file (_v_e_c_t_o_r___o_u_t); otherwise, no neatline  will
       be inserted into the output file.


       Next,  the user is prompted for the name of an existing lines-file con-
       taining the geographic coordinates of the arcs forming polygon  perime-
       ters.   The  lines-file  is  created with the ARC/INFO _U_n_g_e_n_e_r_a_t_e _L_I_N_E_S
       option, and is in the same format at the _p_r_e_f_i_x_._p_o_l file created by the
       _v_._o_u_t_._a_r_c
        program.  The user sees the following prompt:
            LINES FILENAME
            Enter name of the file created with the LINES
            option of the ARC/INFO Ungenerate command.
            Hit RETURN to cancel request
            >

       The  next  prompt  for  coverage type "polygon" asks for the name of an
       existing label-points file.  The label-points file is created with  the
       _U_n_g_e_n_e_r_a_t_e  _P_O_I_N_T_S  option, and is in the same format as the _p_r_e_f_i_x_._l_a_b
       file created by the _v_._o_u_t_._a_r_c
        program.  The user sees the following prompt:
            LABEL-POINTS FILENAME
            Enter name of file created with the POINTS
            option of the ARC/INFO Ungenerate command.
            Hit RETURN if there is no such file
            >

       Finally, the program asks the user for the name of an  existing  label-
       text file.  This file associates each label-point ID number with a text
       string.  It is in the same format as the _p_r_e_f_i_x_._t_x_t file created by the
       _v_._o_u_t_._a_r_c
        program.
            LABEL-TEXT FILENAME
            Enter the name of a file that associates
            label-point ID numbers with text label strings
            Hit RETURN if there is no such file
            >

       _v_._i_n_._a_r_c  then  scans  the label-text file to find the numbers of lines
       and columns, the column headers (if any), and the first three lines  of
       actual data in the file.  It displays this information to standard out-
       put to help the user determine which columns will hold the ID, Category
       value, and Attribute text data in the new vector output file.  A sample
       of the program's output is shown below:
          The LABEL-TEXT file has been scanned. There are 132
          lines in the file and 8 columns in the file

          Column headers of the LABEL-TEXT file:
            rec# AREA PERIMETER SOILS# SOILS-ID  SOIL-CODE  DRAIN_CODE  TXTUR-
       CODE

          Here are the first three lines :
               1   -2.30228E+07  19399.848     1      0      0      0      0
               2     81079.875    1678.826     2      1     15      3      3
               3    955952.500   10229.637     3      2     19      8      8

       The  column  of  category values must contain only integer values.  The
       attribute text column can contain a floating point number, an  integer,
       or a word (text string).


       Finally,  the  user  is  prompted to enter line ID, category value, and
       attribute text column numbers.
            Enter the number of the column that should be used
            for line IDs (probably the column with -ID) :

               Enter the number of the column that is to be used
               for GRASS category values:

               Enter the number of the column that should be used
               for GRASS attribute text:

       Once these column numbers have been entered, _v_._i_n_._a_r_c will  begin  con-
       verting  the  ARC/INFO  "Generate"  format files into GRASS vector file
       format.


       IMPORTING A LINE COVERAGE


       The user will also be prompted for input when importing ARC/INFO  files
       containing  linear features ("line coverage") data.  Like polygon data,
       linear features are constructed by the series of  arcs  (aka,  vectors)
       defining  their  perimeters.   If  the  user selects LINE coverage, the
       prompts seen by the user will be different in two respects  from  those
       for POLYGON coverage.  First, the user will not be asked whether or not
       a neatline is desired;  and second, no label-points file name  will  be
       requested.   In other respects, the treatment of LINE coverage is iden-
       tical to that for POLYGON coverage.


       The user is prompted for the name of the lines-file containing the geo-
       graphic coordinates of these arcs.  The lines-file must first have been
       created with the ARC/INFO _U_n_g_e_n_e_r_a_t_e _L_I_N_E_S option, and is in  the  same
       format as the _p_r_e_f_i_x_._l_i_n file created by the GRASS _v_._o_u_t_._a_r_c
        program.

       Following are examples of the data files discussed above.


       LINES FILE, also known as _p_r_e_f_i_x_._l_i_n or _p_r_e_f_i_x_._p_o_l file.


       This type of file can be created in ARC/INFO by using the _l_i_n_e_s subcom-
       mand of the _U_n_g_e_n_e_r_a_t_e command.   Each line (aka, arc) is defined by  a
       line-ID number, followed by a list of at least two easting and northing
       coordinate pairs, followed by a line with the word "END".  The file  is
       terminated with the word "END".


       The  line-ID  number  is  important only for line coverage data.  For a
       line coverage, the line-ID number is the number  that  associates  each
       line with its attribute data.

       LABEL-POINTS FILE, also known as _p_r_e_f_i_x_._l_a_b file.


       This type of file can be created in ARC/INFO using the _P_o_i_n_t_s option of
       the _U_n_g_e_n_e_r_a_t_e command.  The first number on each line is a label-point

       ARC/INFO  data  can  be imported even if a label-points and/or a label-
       text file are missing;  however, the lines and/or areas  imported  will
       not be labeled.


       _v_._i_n_._a_r_c  can  handle  label-text  files  both  with and without header
       lines.


       Import files are read from any directory, v.in.arc can handle  relative
       or absolute file names with path.
