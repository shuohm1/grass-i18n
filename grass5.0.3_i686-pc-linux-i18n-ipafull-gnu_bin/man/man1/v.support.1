       _v_._s_u_p_p_o_r_t builds GRASS support files for  (binary)  GRASS  vector  data
       files.   These  support  files  supply topology (dig_plus) and category
       (dig_att) information that are needed by other GRASS programs (e.g., by
       _v_._d_i_g_i_t, _v_._t_o_._r_a_s_t, etc.).


       The program gives the user the options of:

               building  topological information (the dig_plus file) needed by
              _v_._d_i_g_i_t for the vector data file, and/or

               editing the category label (dig_cats) file associated with  the
              vector data file.

       Program parameters and flags have the following meanings.

   FFllaaggss::
       --ss     Snap nodes.  Valid only with _b_u_i_l_d option.

       --pp     Prompt  user for threshold value.  Valid only with _b_u_i_l_d option.
              This flag is designed to be used only by the  _v_._i_m_p_o_r_t  program,
              and can usually be ignore.

       --rr     Reset corners of map region from range of data values.


   PPaarraammeetteerrss::
       mmaapp==_n_a_m_e
              Name  of  binary  GRASS vector data file for which support files
              are to be created or modified.  This map layer must exist in the
              user's current GRASS mapset.

       ooppttiioonn==_n_a_m_e
              Build  topology  information (dig_plus file), or edit categories
              (dig_att file) for _m_a_p.
              Options:  _b_u_i_l_d, _e_d_i_t
              Default:  _e_d_i_t

       tthhrreesshhoolldd==_v_a_l_u_e
              Snapping threshold value to  be  used  when  building  topology.
              Specified value is always saved in file header.  (Note: snapping
              is done only with _b_u_i_l_d option and --ss flag).

       eerrrr==_v_a_l_u_e
              Name of new vector binary file, where are saved all  area  edges
              with topology problems like free ends or not closed areas.

       The user can run this program non-interactively by specifying parameter
       values (and optionally, flag settings) on the command line.


       Alternately, the user can simply type the command vv..ssuuppppoorrtt on the com-
       mand  line.   In  this event, the program will prompt the user to enter
       parameter values and flag settings.


       If the _b_u_i_l_d option is chosen, the user  may  further  specify  the  --ss
       flag,  to  snap  nodes in the vector file.  If nodes are to be snapped,
       the user can either:  (1) use the calculated default  threshold  (based
       on  the  scale of vector data); (2) enter the -p flag, causing the pro-
       gram to prompt the user for a snapping threshold value;  or (3) enter a
       specific threshold value on the command line.


       The  spatial  assignment of category values (found in the dig_att file)
       is also performed during building of file topology.


       The _e_d_i_t option allows the user to edit the category labels to be asso-
       ciated  with  the  category  values  attached to the vector data during
       topology building.  These labels, if created, are then used for  raster
       map  layers  derived  from  their  vector counterparts.  The labels are
       placed in the dig_cats directory.

NNOOTTEESS
       A dig_plus file must be created for each imported vector map before  it
       can  be  used  in  post-GRASS 3.0 versions of _d_i_g_i_t (now referred to as
       _v_._d_i_g_i_t).


       Topological information for GRASS vector files can also be built  using
       _o_p_t_i_o_n _4 of the _v_._i_m_p_o_r_t program.


       This  program  will  convert  pre-4.0 version GRASS vector files to 4.0
       format.


       _v_._s_u_p_p_o_r_t creates support files only for binary vector files located in
       the user's current mapset.
