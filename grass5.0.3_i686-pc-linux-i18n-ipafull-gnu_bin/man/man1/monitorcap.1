       mmoonniittoorrccaapp  - Description of device driver database file format.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The  _d_._m_o_n  command  and  all  graphics commands access a device driver
       database stored in the file $GISBASE/etc/monitorcap.   This  file  con-
       tains  a  line for each graphics monitor on the system.  Each line con-
       tains 6 fields separated by colons:

       name   the name by which the user identifies the driver

       program
              the full pathname of the executable driver or a  pathname  rela-
              tive to $GISBASE

       description
              A short 4 or 5 word description of the driver.

       fifos  full  pathnames  to  the  input  and output fifos over which the
              driver communicates with the libraries

       tty    the name of the tty from which the driver must  be  started,  or
              empty if there is no such restriction

       msg    a  message  to  print to the user if an attempt is made to start
              the driver from the wrong tty.


EEXXAAMMPPLLEE
       The following is an example of a single monitor system.  The driver may
       be  started  from any terminal and uses /dev/fifo.a and /dev/fifo.b for
       communication with application programs:


       x:driver/X:graphics monitor:/dev/fifo.a

       /dev/fifo.b::any terminal


       This example has 2 monitors  on  the  system,  using  the  same  device
       driver.  Note that each has a different _n_a_m_e field and uses a different
       pair of fifos.  Also, each must be started on a specific terminal:


       1:driver/X:monitor 1:/dev/fifo.1a
        /dev/fifo.1b:/dev/tty8:tty8
       2:driver/X:monitor 2:/dev/fifo.2a
        /dev/fifo.2b:/dev/tty10:tty10

NNOOTTEESS
       Each line in this file must refer to a valid driver.  No comment  lines
       are supported.  Also, no blank lines are allowed.
