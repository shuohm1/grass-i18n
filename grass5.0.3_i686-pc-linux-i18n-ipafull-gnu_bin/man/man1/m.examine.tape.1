       _m_._e_x_a_m_i_n_e_._t_a_p_e is a convenient tool for previewing a tape and obtaining
       block size values.  After the user enters the command mm..eexxaammiinnee..ttaappee

       the  program  will  prompt  the user for the full path name of the tape
       device on which the tape is mounted.   In  most  cases,  this  will  be
       /dev/rmt0.   However,  the user must enter this, as there is no default
       value for the tape device name.  The user is then prompted to enter the
       buffer  size  to be used when reading the tape.  The buffer size is the
       amount of memory allocated to read one physical record of the tape.  If
       the  user hits RETURN, the program will assume a default buffer size of
       32767 bytes.


       _m_._e_x_a_m_i_n_e_._t_a_p_e reads the tape specified by the user  and  reports  back
       the  block  size (record length) and the number of blocks for each file
       contained on the tape.  _m_._e_x_a_m_i_n_e_._t_a_p_e can be used on any 1/2-inch mag-
       netic  tape.  The user has the option of sending the output into a file
       or viewing the output on the terminal screen.

       The buffer size is the amount of memory allocated to read one  physical
       record  on  the  tape.   Magnetic tape devices will accept a request to
       read more bytes than actually exist in any  given  record  on  a  tape.
       However, _m_._e_x_a_m_i_n_e_._t_a_p_e reads only as many bytes as physically exist on
       the tape and returns the number of bytes actually read.   The  user  is
       allowed  to alter the buffer size in order to request smaller reads for
       tape devices unable to handle requests this large (32767 bytes), or  to
       request  larger reads for tapes with larger record sizes read on drives
       able to handle larger record sizes.


       Note that _m_._e_x_a_m_i_n_e_._t_a_p_e cannot be  used  to  examine  the  content  of
       either ordinary files or 1/4-inch tape cartridges.
