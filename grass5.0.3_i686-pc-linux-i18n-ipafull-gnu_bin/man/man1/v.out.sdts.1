       _v_._o_u_t_._s_d_t_s creates an SDTS dataset that conforms to the requirements of
       both  the federal Spatial Data Transfer Standard and the SDTS Topologi-
       cal Vector Profile.  It creates the dataset from the  files  associated
       with a vector map layer which is specified by the user.  The files that
       make up the SDTS dataset are output to the  current  directory,  unless
       otherwise  specified by the user (with the path parameter).  The output
       dataset is in the  mandatory  ISO  8211  (FIPS  123)  format;  the  ISO
       8211/SDTS output files can be inspected with _m_._s_d_t_s_._r_e_a_d.

       GRASS  makes  a  distinction between types of lines, between those that
       are edges of areas or polygons and those that are not.   GRASS  handles
       these  types different topologically: AREA type lines carry pointers to
       left and right polygons, but LINE type lines carry no such pointers.


       The SDTS Topological Vector Profile, however, does not distinguish line
       types,  and  does  require  that ALL lines carry left and right polygon
       references.  This has meant that during the  export  process  topology-
       building  algorithms are applied to construct the missing topology that
       SDTS requires.  A potential problem arises, however, with the  transfer
       of  object  attributes  in  certain circumstances. E.g. if a polygon in
       GRASS is bisected by a line of type LINE, the  resulting  SDTS  dataset
       will  contain two polygons where only one existed in GRASS: should both
       these polygons be assigned the attribute of the original, now non-exis-
       tent  polygon?   The "-a" option, which transfers only AREA type lines,
       works around this problem.

       SDTS datasets are required to contain 5 different data  quality  report
       modules,  for Lineage, Positional Accuracy, Attribute Accuracy, Logical
       Consistency, and Completeness.  When _v_._o_u_t_._s_d_t_s is run, it searches  in
       the  user's  mapset's _d_i_g___m_i_s_c directory for appropriate files, one for
       each module, containing narrative text in ASCII format.  If found, they
       are  converted to SDTS/ISO 8211 format and added to the export dataset;
       warning messages are displayed if any data quality modules are missing.


       Data  quality reports can be created, and installed in the proper loca-
       tion under _d_i_g___m_i_s_c, with _v_._s_d_t_s_._m_e_t_a.

       When _v_._o_u_t_._s_d_t_s is run, if the "-m" flag is set, the  program  searches
       in the _d_i_g___m_i_s_c directory for a supplementary metadata file for the map
       layer being transferred.  If found, its contents  are  incorporated  in
       the  SDTS  dataset.  This  file  can  be  created  and  installed  with
       _v_._s_d_t_s_._m_e_t_a; for details see the _m_a_n page for this program.

       In addition to the files created by  v.out.sdts,  every  SDTS  transfer
       must  contain a README file.  This file is not generated by _v_._o_u_t_._s_d_t_s,
       and must be created by hand. It should contain:

        .PP    "volume name [if appropriate], date, a list of  SDTS  transfers
              (if  more  than one), and then for each SDTS transfer: a list of
              subdirectories and non-SDTS files, if approriate, the file  name
              of  the  Catalog/Directory module, where it can be found, and an
              explanation that this file and all other SDTS files are  in  ISO
              8211  format,  and  that the Catalog/Directgory module carries a
              complete directory to all other SDTS ISO 8211  files  comprising
              the  SDTS  transfer,  notes about any non-SDTS adjunct/auxiliary
              files, a brief explanation of the spatial domain,  the  purpose,
              authority  (FIPS  173),  source  (e.g. agency name) and contacts

       The  SDTS  dataset produced by _v_._o_u_t_._s_d_t_s contains two attribute module
       files.   One,  containing  attribute  module  "AP00",   stores   global
       attributes,  i.e.,  metadata  items  applicable  to the entire transfer
       (most are  derived  from  the  _d_i_g  file  header).   The  second  holds
       attribute module "AP01", and contains records with two fields: ATTR_NUM
       contains _d_i_g___a_t_t integer values; and  ATTR_LABEL  contains  the  corre-
       sponding labels or descriptions from the _d_i_g___c_a_t_s file.

       Currently,  the user can only create an SDTS dataset from a single vec-
       tor map layer in his or her mapset at a time.
