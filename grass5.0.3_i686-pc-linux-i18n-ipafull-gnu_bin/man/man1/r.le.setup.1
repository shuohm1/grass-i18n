       _r_._l_e_._s_e_t_u_p  - The _r_._l_e_._s_e_t_u_p program is used to set up the sampling and
       analysis framework that will be used by the other _r_._l_e programs.

       The first menu allows the user to define a rectangular sampling  frame,
       select  how sampling will be done (regions, sampling units, moving win-
       dow), setup the limits for groups and classes, and change the color ta-
       ble.  Use the left mouse button to make your choice.


       Information  about  the structure of the landscape is obtained by over-
       laying a set of sampling areas on top of a specified part (the sampling
       frame of a map layer, and then calculating specific structural measures
       for the part of the map layer that corresponds to the area in each sam-
       pling area.


       To  setup  a  ssaammpplliinngg  ffrraammee click on SAMPLING FRAME in the main menu.
       The program will ask "Will the sampling frame (total area within  which
       sampling units are distributed) be the whole map? (y/n)  [y]"  Just hit
       a carriage return to accept the default, which is to use the whole map.
       You  do not need to setup a sampling frame if you want to use the whole
       map, as this is the default.  To setup a different sampling frame  type
       "n" in response to this question.  Then use the mouse and a rubber band
       box to outline a rectangular sampling frame on screen.  This  box  will
       be  moved  to the nearest row and column of the map.  You will be asked
       last whether you want to  "Refresh  the  screen  before  choosing  more
       setup?"   If  you  don't like the sampling frame you just setup, answer
       yes to this question, then click on SAMPLING FRAME again to  redo  this
       part  of the setup.  This sampling frame will be used in all subsequent
       setup procedures unless you change it.  You can change it at  any  time
       by simply clicking on SAMPLING FRAME again.


       A  ssaammpplliinngg  aarreeaa  may be one of four things.  First, it is possible to
       treat the entire map layer as the one (and only) sampling  area.   Sec-
       ond,  if  the  map  layer  can  be divided into meaningful geographical
       regions, then it is possible to treat the regions  themselves  as  sam-
       pling  areas.   The third option is that the sampling areas may be sam-
       pling units of fixed shape and size (also called scale) that are placed
       within  the  map layer as a whole.  The fourth and final option is that
       the sampling area may be moved systematically across the map as a  mov-
       ing window.


       If regions are to be used as the sampling areas , then the user can use
       _r_._l_e_._s_e_t_u_p to draw regions or any existing map of regions can simply be
       used  directly.   To  draw  regions  and  create  a  new regions map in
       _r_._l_e_._s_e_t_u_p select "REGIONS" from the first  _r_._l_e_._s_e_t_u_p  menu,  and  the
       user is asked to do the following:
       1.   "ENTER  THE  NEW  REGION MAP NAME:". Only a new raster map name is
       acceptable. The user
           can type LIST to find out the existing raster  map  names  in  this
       location and mapset.

       2.  "PLEASE  OUTLINE REGION # 1". The user should move the mouse cursor
       into the graphic
          monitor window and use the mouse buttons as instructed:
       Left button: where am I.to display the current coordinates of the  cur-
       sor.
       Middle button: Mark start (next) point. to enter a vertex of the region
       boundary.
       Right button: Finish region-connect to 1st point to  close  the  region
       boundary by setting
          the last vertex to be equal to the first one.

       3.  A  "REGION  OPTIONS:" menu is displayed and the user should use the
       mouse to select one of
          the options:

       "DRAW MORE": repeat the above process and setup another region.
       "START OVER": abandon the previous setup and start all over again.
       "DONE-SAVE": save the regions outlined so far and exit this  procedure.
       "QUIT-NO SAVE": quit the procedure without saving the regions.


       Once the "DONE-SAVE" option is selected, the new raster map of the sam-
       pling regions is generated. It is displayed on the monitor  window  for
       several seconds, the monitor window is refreshed, the main menu is dis-
       played again, and the program is ready for other setup work.  Note that
       you cannot draw regions in areas outside the mask, if a mask is present
       (see _r_._m_a_s_k command).


       The user can also use the GRASS _r_._d_i_g_i_t or _v_._d_i_g_i_t programs to digitize
       circular  or  polygonal  regions  and  to create a sampling regions map
       without using _r_._l_e_._s_e_t_u_p.  Or, as mention above, an existing raster map
       can be used as a regions map.


       If  sampling  units are to be used as the sampling areas (Fig. 2), then
       choose "SAMPLING UNITS" from the first _r_._l_e_._s_e_t_u_p  menu.   The  program
       checks  the  _r_._l_e_._p_a_r_a subdirectory for an existing "units" file from a
       previous setup session and allows the user to rename this file (to save
       it) before proceeding.  The r.le.setup program will otherwise overwrite
       the "units" file.  Then the following choice is displayed followed by a
       series of other choices:
            Which do you want to do?
               (1) Use the keyboard to enter sampling unit parameters
               (2) Draw the sampling units with the mouse
                                          Enter 1 or 2:



       When sampling units are defined using the keyboard, the user inputs the
       shape and size (scale) of the sampling units by  specifying  dimensions
       in  pixels  using the keyboard.  When sampling units are drawn with the
       mouse, the user clicks the mouse to define the sampling  units  in  the
       GRASS  monitor  window, and then actually places the sampling units for
       each scale onto the map.  By placing the units with the mouse the  user
       can directly determine the method of sampling unit distribution as well
       as the shape, size, and number of sampling units.


       If the choice is made to define sampling units using the keyboard,  the
       following series of questions must be answered:
            How many different SCALES do you want (1-15)?


       The  user  is  asked to specify the number of scales that will be used.
       The _r_._l_e programs allow the user to simultaneously sample the same  map
       with  the  same  measures  using  sampling  areas  of  different sizes.
       Currently there can be between 1 and 15  scales  that  can  be  sampled
       simultaneously.  Substantial  output can be produced if many scales are
       used.


       Sampling units must be placed spatially into the landscape.  There  are
       five options for doing this :


       _R_a_n_d_o_m _n_o_n_o_v_e_r_l_a_p_p_i_n_g

       Sampling units are placed in the landscape by randomly choosing numbers
       that specify the location of the upper left  corner  of  each  sampling
       unit,  subject  to  the  constraint  that successive sampling units not
       overlap other sampling units or the edge of  the  landscape,  and  that
       they  must  be entirely within the area defined by the mask (see _r_._m_a_s_k
       command) if one exists.


       _S_y_s_t_e_m_a_t_i_c _c_o_n_t_i_g_u_o_u_s

       Sampling units are placed side by side across the rows.  The user  will
       be able to enter a row and column to indicate where the upper left cor-
       ner of the systematic contiguous framework should be placed.  Rows  are
       numbered  from the top down beginning with row 1 of the sampling frame.
       Columns are numbered from left to right, beginning with column 1 of the
       sampling  frame.  A random starting location can be obtained by using a
       standard random number table to choose the  starting  row  and  column.
       The _r_._l_e_._s_e_t_u_p program does not avoid placing the set of sampling units
       over areas outside the mask.  The user will have to make sure that sam-
       pling  units  do  not  extend outside the mask by choosing a particular
       starting row and column or by drawing a sampling frame  before  placing
       the set of sampling units.


       _S_y_s_t_e_m_a_t_i_c _n_o_n_c_o_n_t_i_g_u_o_u_s

       The  user  must  specify the starting row and column as in #2 above and
       the amount of spacing (in pixels) between sampling  units.   Horizontal
       and  vertical  spacing  are identical.  Sampling units are again placed
       side by side (but spaced) across the rows.  As in #2 the  program  does
       not avoid placing sampling units outside the masked area; the user will
       have to position the set of units to avoid areas outside the mask.


       _S_t_r_a_t_i_f_i_e_d _r_a_n_d_o_m

       The strata are rectangular areas within which single sampling units are
       randomly  located.   The  user  must first specify the starting row and
       column as in #2 above.  Then the user must specify the number of strata
       in  the horizontal and vertical directions.   As in #2 the program does
       not avoid placing sampling units outside the masked area; the user will
       have to position the set of units to avoid areas outside the mask.


       _C_e_n_t_e_r_e_d _o_v_e_r _s_i_t_e_s

       The  user  must  specify  the name of a sitefile containing point loca-
       tions.  A single sampling unit is placed with its center over each site
       in  the site file.  This is a useful approach for determining the land-
       scape structure around points, such as around the location of  wildlife
       observations.


       The  user  is  prompted  to enter a ratio that defines the shape of the
       sampling  units.   Sampling  units  may  have  any  rectangular  shape,
       including  square as a special case of rectangular.  Rectangular shapes
       are specified by entering the ratio of columns/rows (horizontal  dimen-
       sion/vertical  dimension)  as  a real number.  For example, to obtain a
       sampling unit 10 columns wide by 4 rows long specify the ratio  as  2.5
       (10/4).
            Recommended maximum SIZE is m in x cell total area.

            What size (in cells) for each sampling unit of scale n?


       The user is then given the recommended maximum possible size for a sam-
       pling unit (in pixels) and asked to input the size of sampling units at
       each scale.  Sampling units can be of any size, but the maximum size is
       the size of the landscape as a whole.  All  the  sampling  units,  that
       make  up  a single sampling scale, are the same size.  After specifying
       the size, the program determines the nearest actual number of rows  and
       columns,  and  hence size, that is closest to the requested size, given
       the shape requested earlier.
            The nearest size is x cells wide X y cells high = xy cells
            Is this size OK?  (y/n)  [y]

            Maximum NUMBER of units in scale n is p?
            What NUMBER of sampling units do you want to try to use?


       The maximum number of units that can be placed over the map, given  the
       shape  and  size of the units, is then given.  The user can then choose
       the number of sampling units to be used in the map layer.  It  may  not
       always  be  possible  to  choose the maximum number, depending upon the
       shape of the sampling units.  In the case of systematic contiguous  and
       noncontiguous, the program will indicate how many units will fit across
       the columns and down the rows.  The user can then specify a  particular
       layout  (e.g.,  6  units could be placed as 2 rows of 3 per row or as 3
       rows of 2 per row).
            Is this set of sampling units OK?  (y/n)  [y]


       Finally, the set of sampling units is displayed on  the  screen  (e.g.,
       Fig.  1) and the user is asked whether it is acceptable.  If the answer
       is no, then the user is asked if the screen should be refreshed  before
       redisplaying  the  menu  for "Methods of sampling unit distribution" so
       that the user can try the sampling unit setup again.


       The choice is made to define sampling units using the mouse,  then  the
       following menu for use with the mouse is displayed:
            Outline the standard sampling unit of scale n.
               Left button:     Check unit size
               Middle button:   Move cursor
               Right button:    Lower right corner of unit here


       The  user can then use the mouse and the rubber band box to outline the
       standard sampling unit.  Once it  has  been  outlined,  the  number  of
       columns and rows in the unit, the ratio of width/length and the size of
       the unit, in cells, will be displayed.  After this first unit  is  out-
       lined, then a new menu is displayed:
            Outline more sampling units of scale n?
               Left button:     Exit
               Middle button:   Not used
               Right button:    Lower right corner of next unit here


       The  user  can  then place more units identical to the standard unit by
       simply clicking the right mouse button where the lower right corner  of
       the  unit  should  be  placed.   The rest of the rubber band box can be
       ignored while placing additional units.  The program is set up so  that
       units cannot be placed so they overlap one another, so they overlap the
       area outside the mask, or so they overlap  the  edge  of  the  sampling
       frame.  Warning messages are issued for all three of these errors and a
       sampling unit is simply not placed.


       Using this procedure a rectangular "window" or single sampling area  is
       moved  systematically  across  the map to produce a new map (Fig. 2,3).
       This sampling procedure can only be used with the measures that produce
       a  single  value  or with a single class or group when measures produce
       distributions of values (Table 1).  The first class or group  specified
       when defining class or group limits (section 2.3.2.) is used if distri-
       butional measures are chosen with the moving  window  sampling  method.
       In  this case, the user should manually edit the _r_._l_e_._p_a_r_a_/_r_e_c_l___t_b file
       so that the desired group is listed as the first group in this file.


       Sampling begins with the upper left corner of the  window  placed  over
       the  upper  left  corner  of the sampling frame.  It is strongly recom-
       mended that the user read the section on the GRASS mask (section 2.2.2)
       prior  to  setting  up  the  moving window, as this mask can be used to
       speed up the moving window operation.  The value of the chosen  measure
       is calculated for the window area.  This value is assigned to the loca-
       tion on the new map layer corresponding to the center pixel in the win-
       dow  if  the  window  has  odd  (e.g.  3 X 3) dimensions.  The value is
       assigned to the location on the new  map  layer  corresponding  to  the
       first pixel below and to the right of the center if the window has even
       dimensions (e.g. 6 X 10).  If this pixel has the value "0," which means
       "no  data"  in  GRASS, then this pixel is skipped and a value of "0" is
       assigned to the corresponding location in the new map.  The  window  is
       then  moved to the right (across the row) by one pixel, and the process
       is repeated.  At the end of the row,  the  window  is  moved  down  one
       pixel,  and  then  back across the row.  This option produces a new map
       layer, whose dimensions are smaller by approximately (m-1)/2  rows  and
       columns, where m is the number of rows or columns in the window.


       If  the  "MOVE-WINDOW"  option  in the main menu is selected, first the
       program checks for an existing "move_wind" file, in the r.le.para  sub-
       directory, containing moving window specifications from a previous ses-
       sion.  The user is given the option to avoid overwriting this  file  by
       entering a new file name for the old "move_wind" file.  Users should be
       aware that moving window analyses are very slow, because a large number
       of  sampling  units  are,  in  effect, used.  See the appendix on "Time
       needed to complete analyses with the  r.le  programs"  for  some  ideas
       about  how moving window size and sampling frame area affect the needed
       time to complete the analyses.


       The _r_._l_e programs _r_._l_e_._d_i_s_t and _r_._l_e_._p_a_t_c_h allow  the  attribute  cate-
       gories  in the input map to be reclassed into several attribute groups,
       and reports the analysis results by each of these attribute groups.  It
       is  necessary  to  setup group limits for all measures that say "by gp"
       when typing "_r_._l_e_._d_i_s_t _h_e_l_p" or "_r_._l_e_._p_a_t_c_h _h_e_l_p" at the GRASS  prompt.
       The  same  reclassing  can  be done with the measurement indices (e.g.,
       size), except that each "cohort" (class) of the  reclassed  indices  is
       called  an  index  class  instead  of a group.  It is also necessary to
       setup class limits for all measures that say  "by  class"  when  typing
       "_r_._l_e_._d_i_s_t _h_e_l_p" or "_r_._l_e_._p_a_t_c_h _h_e_l_p" at the GRASS prompt.


       Group/class  limits are setup by choosing "GROUP/CLASS LIMITS" from the
       main menu upon starting _r_._l_e_._s_e_t_u_p, or you can create the  files  manu-
       ally  using a text editor.  The program checks for existing group/class
       limit files in subdirectory _r_._l_e_._p_a_r_a and allows  the  user  to  rename
       these files prior to continuing.  If the files are not renamed the pro-
       gram will overwrite them.  The files are named recl_tb (attribute group
       limits),  size  (size class limits), shape_PA (shape index class limits
       for perimeter/area index), shape_CPA (shape index class limits for cor-
       rected  perimeter/area  index), shape_RCC (shape index class limits for
       related circumscribing circle index), and from_to  (for  the  _r_._l_e_._d_i_s_t
       program distance methods m7-m9).


       Attribute  groups and index classes are defined in a different way.  In
       the _r_._l_e programs attribute groups are  defined  as  in  the  following
       example:
            1, 3, 5, 7, 9 tthhrruu 21 = 1 (comment)
            31 tthhrruu 50 = 2 (comment)
            eenndd


       In  this  example,  the existing categories 1, 3, 5, 7, {9, 10, ... 20,
       21} are included in the new group 1, while {31, 32, 33,  ...,  49,  50}
       are  included  in the new group 2.  The characters in bold are the "key
       words" that are required in the definition.  Each line  is  called  one
       "reclass rule".


       The GRASS reclass convention is adopted here with a little modification
       (see "_r_._r_e_c_l_a_s_s" command in the GRASS User's Manual).   The  difference
       is  that  r.le  only  allows  one  rule  for each group while the GRASS
       _r_._r_e_c_l_a_s_s command allows more than one. The definition  of  "from"  and
       "to"  groups  is  simply  the extension of the GRASS reclass rule.  The
       advantage of using the GRASS reclass convention is that  the  user  can
       generate a permanent reclassed map, using GRASS programs, directly from
       the _r_._l_e setup results.


       The _r_._l_e measurement index classes are defined by the lower  limits  of
       the classes, as in the following example:
            0.0, 10.0, 50.0, 200.0, --999999


       This means:
            if v >= 0.0 and v < 10.0 then  v belongs to index class 1;
            if v >= 10.0 and v < 50.0 then  v belongs to index class 2;
            if v >= 50.0 and v < 200.0 then v belongs to index class 3;
            if v >= 200.0 then v belongs to index class 4;


       where  v  is  the  calculated index value and --999999 marks the end of the
       index class definition. The measurement index can be  the  size  index,
       one  of  the three shape indices, or one of the three distance indices.
       The program is currently designed to allow no more  than  25  attribute
       groups,  25 size classes, 25 shape index classes, and 25 distance index
       classes.  As an alternative, the user may  want  to  permanently  group
       certain  attributes  prior to entering the _r_._l_e programs.  For example,
       the user may want to group attributes 1-10, in a map  whose  attributes
       are ages, into a single attribute representing young patches.  The user
       can do this using the GRASS _r_._r_e_c_l_a_s_s and  _r_._r_e_s_a_m_p_l_e  commands,  which
       will create a new map layer that can then be analyzed directly (without
       setting up group limits) with the _r_._l_e programs.
