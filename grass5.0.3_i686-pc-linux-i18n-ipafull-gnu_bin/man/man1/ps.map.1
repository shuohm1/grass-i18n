       _p_s_._m_a_p  produces an output file containing a PostScript program to pro-
       duce hardcopy map products on your system's PostScript  output  device.
       Output  can  include  a raster map, any number of vector overlays, site
       data, text labels, and other spatial data.


       This program has 2 distincts modes of operation.  The command-line mode
       requires  the user to prepare a file of mapping instructions describing
       the various spatial and textual information to be printed prior to run-
       ning  _p_s_._m_a_p.   The  interactive mode (i.e., no command-line arguments)
       will prompt the user for items to be mapped and does  not  require  the
       user  to  prepare  a file of instructions (some options are not used in
       interactive mode).


       The command line flag is:

       --rr     Rotate plot 90 degrees.




       The command-line parameters are:

       iinnppuutt==_n_a_m_e
              File containing mapping  instructions.   (or  enter  iinnppuutt==--  to
              enter  from  keyboard).   These  instructions  are  described in
              detail below.

       ssccaallee==_m_a_p_s_c_a_l_e
              Scale of the output map,  e.g. 1:25000
              Default:  1 panel


       This parameter is provided as a convenience.  It is  identical  to  the
       _s_c_a_l_e mapping instruction described below.

       oouuttppuutt==_n_a_m_e
              Name of output the file to contain the PostScript program.




       Note:  the  user must select a PostScript output device using _p_s_._s_e_l_e_c_t
       before running _p_s_._m_a_p.



MMAAPPPPIINNGG IINNSSTTRRUUCCTTIIOONNSS
       The mapping instructions allow the user to specify various spatial data
       to  be  plotted.  These instructions are normally prepared in a regular
       text file using a system editor.  Some  instructions  are  single  line
       instructions while others are multiple line. Multiple line instructions
       consist of the main instruction followed by a subsection of one or more
       additional instructions.


       Instructions  that may be included in the subsection under several dif-
       ferent main instructions are:

       wwhheerree _x _y
              The top left corner of the bounding box of the item to be  plot-
              ted  is  located  _x inches from the left edge of the paper and _y
              inches from the top edge of the paper. If  _x  is  less  than  or
              equal to zero, the default horizontal location is used.  If _y is
              less than or equal to zero, the  default  vertical  location  is
              used.

       ffoonntt _f_o_n_t _n_a_m_e
              The name of the PostScript font.  The default is _H_e_l_v_e_t_i_c_a.

       ffoonnttssiizzee _f_o_n_t _s_i_z_e
              The  size  of  the PostScript font in 1/72 inch.  The default is
              10.



ccoolloorrttaabbllee
       Prints the color table for the raster map layer anywhere on the page.
       USAGE:    ccoolloorrttaabbllee [y|n]
            wwhheerree x y
            wwiiddtthh table width
            hheeiigghhtt table height (FP legend only)
            ccoollss table columns
            ffoonntt font name
            ffoonnttssiizzee font size
            ccoolloorr text color
            nnooddaattaa [y|n]
            eenndd

       The color table will display the colors for each raster map layer cate-
       gory value and the category label.  To get a color table, you must have
       previously requested a raster map layer.  The default location for  the
       colortable  is  immediately  below  any  other  map legend information,
       starting at the left margin.  The default text color is  black.   Omit-
       ting  the  ccoolloorrttaabbllee  instruction  would result in no color table. For
       floating point legends wwiiddtthh is width of color  band  only.  hheeiigghhtt  is
       used only for floating point legend.


       NNoottee:   Be  careful about asking for color tables for raster map layers
       which have many categories, such as elevation.  This  could  result  in
       the printing of an extremely long color table!!!!!


       Another  issue  is  that the color table only includes categories which
       have a label. If there are only a few categories, you can use r.support
       to  manually  add  labels. If there are too many categories to do this,
       you could write a script to add dummy labels to the cats file

       (//<;mapset>;/cats/<;mapname>;).


       This example would print a color table immediately below any other  map
       legend information, starting at the left margin.
       EXAMPLE:
            ccoolloorrttaabbllee y




ccoommmmeennttss
       Prints comments anywhere on the page.
       USAGE:    ccoommmmeennttss commentfile
            wwhheerree x y
            ffoonntt font name
            ffoonnttssiizzee font size
            ccoolloorr text color
            eenndd

       The  default  location is immediately below the last item item printed,
       starting at the left margin.  The default text color is black.


       This example prints in blue whatever is in the file _v_e_g_._c_o_m_m_e_n_t_s start-
       ing  at  1.5 inches from the left edge of the page and 7.25 inches from
       the top of the page, using a 15/72 inch Helvetica Bold font.
       EXAMPLE:
            rraasstteerr vegetation
            ccoommmmeennttss veg.comments
            wwhheerree 1.5 7.25
            ffoonntt Helvetica Bold
            ffoonnttssiizzee 15
            ccoolloorr blue
            eenndd

       Presumably, the file _v_e_g_._c_o_m_m_e_n_t_s contain comments  pertaining  to  the
       raster map layer _v_e_g_e_t_a_t_i_o_n, such as "This map was created by classify-
       ing a LANDSAT TM image".



ccooppiieess
       Specifies the number of copies to be printed.
       USAGE:    ccooppiieess n

       Each page will be printed n times.



eeppss
       Places EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) pictures on the output map.
       USAGE:    eeppss east north
            eeppss x% y%
            eeppssffiillee EPS file
            ssccaallee #
            rroottaattee #
            mmaasskkeedd [y|n]
            eenndd

       The EPS picture location is entered in the  main  instruction  line  by
       giving  either  the map coordinates or by using percentages of the geo-
       graphic region.  The user must specify full EPS file path eeppssffiillee.  The
       user  may  also  specify  the  ssccaallee  of the icon (default is 1.0), the
       rroottaattee i.e. rotation in degrees (default is 0) and whether the point is
       to be mmaasskkeedd by the current mask. (See manual entry for _r_._m_a_s_k
        for more information on the mask.)


       This  example  would  place  a  EPS  file  ./epsf/logo.eps at the point
       (E456000 N7890000).  This picture would be rotated  20  degrees  clock-
       wise,  3  times bigger than in original file and would not be masked by
       the current mask.
       EXAMPLE:
            eeppss 456000 7890000
            eeppssffiillee ./epsf/logo.eps
            ssccaallee 3
            rroottaattee 20
            mmaasskkeedd n
            eenndd

       Of course, multiple  EPS  pictures  may  be  drawn  with  multiple  _e_p_s
       instructions.



ggrreeyyrraasstt
       Selects a raster map layer for output in shades of grey.
       USAGE:    ggrreeyyrraasstt mapname|_l_i_s_t

       For  each _p_s_._m_a_p run, only one raster map layer can be requested (using
       either the _g_r_e_y_r_a_s_t or the _r_a_s_t_e_r instruction).



ggrriidd
       Overlays a coordinate grid onto the output map.
       USAGE:    ggrriidd spacing
            ccoolloorr color
            nnuummbbeerrss # [color]
            ffoonntt font name
            ffoonnttssiizzee font size
            eenndd

       The ssppaacciinngg of the grid is given (in the geographic  coordinate  system
       units) on the main instruction line.  The subsection instructions allow
       the user to specify the ccoolloorr of the  grid  lines,  whether  coordinate
       nnuummbbeerrss  should  appear  on  the  grid lines, and if they should appear
       every grid line (1), every other grid line (2), etc.,  and  what  color
       the  numbers should be.  The defaults are black grid lines, unnumbered.


       This example would overlay a green grid with a spacing of 10000  meters
       (for a metered database, like UTM) onto the output map.  Alternate grid
       lines would be numbered with red numbers.
       EXAMPLE:
            ggrriidd 10000
            ccoolloorr green
            nnuummbbeerrss 2 red
            eenndd




ggrroouupp
       Selects an RGB imagery group for output.
       USAGE:    ggrroouupp _g_r_o_u_p_n_a_m_e

       This is similar to _r_a_s_t_e_r, except that it uses an imagery group instead
       of  a raster map layer. The group must contain three raster map layers,
       comprising the red, green and blue bands of the image.



hheeaaddeerr
       Prints the map header above the map.
       USAGE:    hheeaaddeerr
            ffiillee header file
            ffoonntt font name
            ffoonnttssiizzee font size
            ccoolloorr text color
            eenndd

       If the _h_e_a_d_e_r instruction or the _f_i_l_e sub-instruction  is  absent,  the
       header will consist of the map TITLE and location, each centered on the
       page above the map.  The default text color is black.


       This example prints (in red) whatever is in the  file  _s_o_i_l_s_._h_d_r  above
       the map, using a 20/72 inch Courier font.
       EXAMPLE:
            hheeaaddeerr
            ffiillee soils.hdr
            ffoonntt Courier
            ffoonnttssiizzee 20
            ccoolloorr red
            eenndd




llaabbeellss
       Selects a labels file for output (see manual entry for _p_._l_a_b_e_l_s _)_.
       USAGE:    llaabbeellss  labelfile|_l_i_s_t
            ffoonntt font name
            eenndd



       NOTE:  ps.map  can  read  new  option 'ROTATE:' from labels file, which
       specifies counter clockwise rotation in degrees.


       This example would paint labels from the labels file called _t_o_w_n_._n_a_m_e_s.
       Presumably,  these labels would indicate the names of towns on the map.
       EXAMPLE:
            llaabbeellss town.names




lliinnee
       Draws lines on the output map.
       USAGE:    lliinnee east north east north
            lliinnee x% y% x% y%
            ccoolloorr color
            wwiiddtthh #
            mmaasskkeedd [y|n]
            eenndd

       The beginning and ending points of the line are  entered  on  the  main
       instruction.   These points can be defined either by map coordinates or
       by using percentages of the geographic region.  The user may also spec-
       ify  line  ccoolloorr,  wwiiddtthh  in  pixels  (accepts decimal points [floating
       points] as well as integers), and if the line is to be  mmaasskkeedd  by  the
       current mask. (See manual entry for _r_._m_a_s_k
        for more information on the mask.)


       This example would draw a yellow line from the point x=10% y=80% to the
       point x=30% y=70%. This line would be 2 pixels wide  and  would  appear
       even if there is a mask.
       EXAMPLE:
            lliinnee 10% 80% 30% 70%
            ccoolloorr yellow
            wwiiddtthh 2
            mmaasskkeedd n
            eenndd

       Of course, multiple lines may be drawn with multiple _l_i_n_e instructions.



mmaappiinnffoo
       Prints the portion of the map legend containing  the  scale,  grid  and
       region information, on or below the map.
       USAGE:    mmaappiinnffoo
            wwhheerree x y
            ffoonntt font name
            ffoonnttssiizzee font size
            ccoolloorr text color
            eenndd

       The default location is immediately below the map, starting at the left
       edge of the map.  The default text color is black.


       This example prints (in brown) the scale, grid and  region  information
       immediately below the map and starting 1.5 inches from the left edge of
       the page, using a 12/72 inch Courier font.
       EXAMPLE:
            mmaappiinnffoo
            wwhheerree 1.5 0
            ffoonntt Courier
            ffoonnttssiizzee 12
            ccoolloorr brown
            eenndd




mmaapplloocc
       Positions the map on the page.
       USAGE:    mmaapplloocc  x y [width height]

       The upper left corner of the map will be positioned _x inches  from  the
       left  edge of the page and _y inches from the top of the page.  If _w_i_d_t_h
       and _h_e_i_g_h_t (in inches) are present, the map will be rescaled, if neces-
       sary, to fit.


       This example positions the upper left corner of the map 2.0 inches from
       the left edge and 3.5 inches from the top edge of the map.
       EXAMPLE:
            mmaapplloocc 2.0 3.5




oouuttlliinnee
       Outlines the areas of a raster map layer with a specified color.
       USAGE:    oouuttlliinnee
            ccoolloorr  color
            wwiiddtthh  width of line in pixels
            eenndd

       Distinct areas of the raster map will  be  separated  from  each  other
       visually  by  drawing  a  border  (or  outline)  in the specified ccoolloorr
       (default: black). For wwiiddtthh the program accepts decimal points  [float-
       ing  points] as well as integers.  Note: it is important the user enter
       the instruction eenndd even if a color is not chosen.  (It is  hoped  that
       in  the  future  the outline of a different raster map layer other than
       the one currently being painted may be placed on the map.)


       This example would outline the category areas of the _s_o_i_l_s  raster  map
       layer in grey.
       EXAMPLE:
            rraasstteerr soils
            oouuttlliinnee
            ccoolloorr grey
            wwiiddtthh 2
            eenndd




ppooiinntt
       Places additional points or icons on the output map.
       USAGE:    ppooiinntt east north
            ppooiinntt x% y%
            ccoolloorr color
            iiccoonn iconfile|_l_i_s_t
            ssiizzee #
            mmaasskkeedd [y|n]
            eenndd

       The  point  location  is entered in the main instruction line by giving
       either the map coordinates or by using percentages  of  the  geographic
       region.  The user may also specify the point ccoolloorr, the iiccoonn file to be
       used to represent the point location (see  the  the  manual  entry  for
       _p_s_._i_c_o_n  _s_), the ssiizzee of the icon as a multiple of the size of the pat-
       tern in the icon file (default is 1.0, aprroximately equivalent to a 10
       point  character), and whether the point is to be mmaasskkeedd by the current
       mask. (See manual entry for _r_._m_a_s_k
        for more information on the mask.)


       This example would place a purple diamond (from icon file  _d_i_a_m_o_n_d)  at
       the  point (E456000 N7890000).  This diamond would be the approximately
       the size of a 15 point character and would not be masked by the current
       mask.
       EXAMPLE:
            ppooiinntt 456000 7890000
            ccoolloorr purple
            iiccoonn diamond
            ssiizzee 1.5
            mmaasskkeedd n
            eenndd

       Of  course,  multiple  points may be drawn with multiple _p_o_i_n_t instruc-
       tions.



ppssffiillee
       Copies a file containing PostScript commands into the output file.


       NNoottee:: _p_s_._m_a_p will not search for this file.  The user must  be  in  the
       correct  directory  or specify the full path on the ppssffiillee instruction.
       (Note to /bin/csh users: ~ won't work with this instruction).
       USAGE:    ppssffiillee filename

       This example copies the file "logo.ps" into the output file.
       EXAMPLE:
            ppssffiillee logo.ps




rraasstteerr
       Selects a raster map layer for output.
       USAGE:    rraasstteerr mapname|_l_i_s_t

       For each _p_s_._m_a_p run, only one raster map layer (or  set  of  layers  or
       imagery  group;  see below) can be requested. If no raster map layer is
       requested, a completely white map will be produced. It can be useful to
       select  no  raster map layer in order to provide a white background for
       vector images.


       Note that an imagery group selected with the _g_r_o_u_p option, or a set  of
       three raster layers selected with the _r_g_b option, count as a raster map
       layer for the purposes of the preceding paragraph.


       This example would paint a map of the raster map layer _s_o_i_l_s.
       EXAMPLE:
            rraasstteerr soils




rreeaadd
       Provides _p_s_._m_a_p with a previously prepared input stream.
       USAGE:    rreeaadd previously prepared UNIX file

       Mapping instructions can be placed into a file and read into _p_s_._m_a_p_.


       NNoottee:: _p_s_._m_a_p will not search for this file.  The user must  be  in  the
       correct  directory  or  specify  the full path on the rreeaadd instruction.
       (Note to /bin/csh users: ~ won't work with this instruction).


       This example reads the UNIX file _p_m_a_p_._r_o_a_d_s into _p_s_._m_a_p.  This file may
       contain  all  the  _p_s_._m_a_p instructions for placing the vector map layer
       _r_o_a_d_s onto the output map.
       EXAMPLE:
            rreeaadd pmap.roads

       The user may have created this file because this vector  map  layer  is
       particularly useful for many _p_s_._m_a_p outputs.  By using the rreeaadd option,
       the user need not enter all the input for the vveeccttoorr  instruction,  but
       simply rreeaadd the previously prepared file with the correct instructions.



rreeccttaannggllee
       Draws rectangle on the output map.
       USAGE:    rreeccttaannggllee east north east north
            rreeccttaannggllee x% y% x% y%
            ccoolloorr color
            ffccoolloorr fill color
            wwiiddtthh #
            mmaasskkeedd [y|n]
            eenndd

       The two corners of the rectangle are entered on the  main  instruction.
       These  points can be defined either by map coordinates or by using per-
       centages of the geographic region.  The  user  may  also  specify  line
       ccoolloorr,  fill  color  ffccoolloorr,  wwiiddtthh  in  pixels (accepts decimal points
       [floating points] as well as integers), and if the rectangle is  to  be
       mmaasskkeedd by the current mask. (See manual entry for _r_._m_a_s_k
        for more information on the mask.)


       This  example  would  draw  a yellow rectangle filled by green from the
       point x=10% y=80% to the point x=30% y=70%. This line would be 2 pixels
       wide and would appear even if there is a mask.
       EXAMPLE:
            rreeccttaannggllee 10% 80% 30% 70%
            ccoolloorr yellow
            ffccoolloorr green
            wwiiddtthh 2
            mmaasskkeedd n
            eenndd

       Of  course,  multiple  rectangles  may be drawn with multiple _r_e_c_t_a_n_g_l_e
       instructions.



rreeggiioonn
       Places the outline of a smaller geographic region on the output.
       USAGE:    rreeggiioonn regionfile|_l_i_s_t
            ccoolloorr color
            wwiiddtthh #
            eenndd

       Geographic region settings are created and saved using _g_._r_e_g_i_o_n .   The
       _p_s_._m_a_p _r_e_g_i_o_n option can be used to show an outline of a smaller region
       which was printed on a separate run of  _p_s_._m_a_p  on  other  user-created
       maps.


       The  user  can  specify the ccoolloorr and the wwiiddtthh in pixel units (accepts
       decimal points [floating points] as well as integers) of  the  outline.
       The default is a black border of one pixel width.


       This  example  would  place a white outline, 2 pixels wide, of the geo-
       graphic region called _f_i_r_e_._z_o_n_e_s onto the output map.  This  geographic
       region would have been created and saved using _g_._r_e_g_i_o_n .
       EXAMPLE:
            rreeggiioonn fire.zones
            ccoolloorr white
            wwiiddtthh 2
            eenndd




rrggbb
       Selects three raster map layers for output as an RGB color image.
       USAGE:    rrggbb _r_e_d _g_r_e_e_n _b_l_u_e

       This  is similar to _r_a_s_t_e_r, except that it uses three raster map layers
       instead of a single layer. The three layers  are  composed  to  form  a
       color image, similar to _d_._r_g_b.


       For  each  layer, only one of the components of the layer's color table
       is used: the red component for the red layer, and  so  on.   This  will
       give  the  desired  result if all of the layers have a grey-scale color
       table, or if each layer's color table uses the hue appropriate  to  the
       layer.



ssccaallee
       Selects a scale for the output map.
       USAGE:    ssccaallee _s_c_a_l_e

       The scale can be selected either as:

        a relative ratio, e.g. 1:25000;

        an absolute width of the printed map, e.g. 10 inches;

        the number of printed paper panels, e.g. 3 panels
              _(_a_t _t_h_e _p_r_e_s_e_n_t _t_i_m_e_, _o_n_l_y _1 _p_a_n_e_l _i_s _s_u_p_p_o_r_t_e_d_)_;

        the number of miles per inch, e.g. 1 inch equals 4 miles.


       This example would set the scale of the map to 1 unit = 25000 units.
       EXAMPLE:
            ssccaallee 1:25000




sseettccoolloorr
       Overrides  the  color  assigned to one or more categories of the raster
       map layer.
       USAGE:    sseettccoolloorr cat(s) color

       This example would set the color for categories 2,5 and 8 of the raster
       map  layer  _w_a_t_e_r_s_h_e_d_s  to  white  and category 10 to green.  (NNOOTTEE: no
       spaces are inserted between the category values.)
       EXAMPLE:
            rraasstteerr watersheds
            sseettccoolloorr 2,5,8 white
            sseettccoolloorr 10 green

       Of course, _s_e_t_c_o_l_o_r can be requested more than  once  to  override  the
       default color for additional categories.  More than one category can be
       changed for each request by listing all the category  values  separated
       by commas (but with no spaces).



ssiitteess
       Selects sites data to be placed on the output map (see manual entry for
       _s_._m_e_n_u ).
       USAGE:    ssiitteess sitemap|_l_i_s_t
            ccoolloorr color
            iiccoonn iconfile|_l_i_s_t

            ddeesscc [y|n]
            ffoonntt font name
            eenndd

       The user may specify the the ccoolloorr of the sites (see section  on  NAMED
       COLORS  below); the iiccoonn to be used to represent the presence of a site
       (see the manual entry for _p_._i_c_o_n_s );  the  eeppss  Encapsulate  Postscript
       file  to  be  used to represent the presence of a site; If $$ is used in
       EPS file path it is replaced by category number.  the ssiizzee of the  icon
       (number  of  times  larger  than  the size it is in the icon file); the
       ssiizzee__aatttt number of attribute used for size (if used size  is  equal  to
       size  *  attribute_value); the rroottaattee in degrees for clockwise rotation
       for EPS files; and whether or not the ddeessccription associated with  each
       site  is  also to be printed.  If the ddeessccription is to be printed, the
       ffoonntt name may be specified.  The size of the font  is  proportional  to
       the  icon  ssiizzee.   This example would paint a sites map with blue wind-
       mills (from an icon file created by the user using  the  _p_._i_c_o_n_s  GRASS
       command)  placed  at all windmill locations (from a sites list).  These
       windmills would be two times larger than the size of the  icon  in  the
       icon file and have descriptions from the sites list file printed beside
       them.
       EXAMPLE:
            ssiitteess windmills
            ccoolloorr blue

            ooppaaqquuee [y|n]
            eenndd

       The user specifies where the text will be placed by providing map coor-
       dinates  or percentages of the geographic region map.  The text follows
       these coordinates on the same instruction line.  More than one line  of
       text  can  be  specified  by  notating the end of a line with 00ffRR ((ee..gg..
       UUSSAA00EERRLL))..


       The user can then specify various text features:


       ffoonntt:: cyrilc gothgbt gothgrt gothitt greekc greekcs greekp greeks ital-
       icc  italiccs  italict  romanc  romancs  romand  romans  romant scriptc
       scripts (The default font is romans);


       ccoolloorr (see NAMED COLORS);


       wwiiddtthh of the lines used to  draw  the  text  to  make  thicker  letters
       (accepts decimal points [floating points] as well as integers);


       ssiizzee  as  the  vertical  height  of the letters in meters on the ground
       (text size will grow or shrink depending on the scale at which the  map
       is painted);


       the  highlight  color  (hhccoolloorr)  and  the  width of the highlight color
       (hhwwiiddtthh);


       the text-enclosing-box bbaacckkggrroouunndd color; the text box bboorrddeerr color;


       rreeff..  This reference point specifies the text handle - what part of the
       text should be placed on the location specified by the map coordinates.
       Reference points can refer to: [lower|upper|center] [left|right|center]
       of the text to be printed;


       yyooffffsseett,  which provides finer placement of text by shifting the text a
       vertical distance in pixels from the  specified  north.   The  vertical
       offset will shift the location to the south if positive, north if nega-
       tive;


       xxooffffsseett, which shifts the text a horizontal distance in pixels from the
       specified  east  The  horizontal offset will shift the location east if
       positive, west if negative;


       whether or not the text should be ooppaaqquuee to vectors.   Entering  nnoo  to
       the  opaque  option  will  allow  the  user to see any vectors which go
       through the text's background box.  Otherwise, they  will  end  at  the
       box's edge.




       This  example  would place the text _S_P_E_A_R_F_I_S_H _L_A_N_D _C_O_V_E_R at the coordi-
       nates E650000 N7365000. The text would be a total of 3 pixels  wide  (2
       pixels  of  red  text  and 1 pixel black highlight), have a white back-
       ground enclosed in a red box, and be 500 meters  in  size.   The  lower
       right  corner  of  the text would be centered over the coordinates pro-
       vided.  All vectors on the map would stop at the border of this text.

       The user can specify:


       ccoolloorr - color of the vector lines or area boundaries;


       aaccoolloorr - the area color. If acolor is used areas are plotted instead of
       lines  (accepts  3 integers from 0 to 255 for red, green and blue sepa-
       rated by spaces). This color is also used by pattern until  overwritten
       in pattern file;


       wwiiddtthh  -  width  of  the  vectors  lines  or  area boundaries in pixels
       (accepts decimal points [floating points] as well as integers);


       ccwwiiddtthh - width of the vectors lines. If cwidth is used  then  width  of
       line is equal to cwidth * category value and width is used in legend;


       hhccoolloorr - the highlight color for the vector lines;


       hhwwiiddtthh - the width of the highlight color in pixels;


       ooffffsseett  (experimental)  -  offset  for  the vectors lines in pixels for
       plotting parallel lines in distance equal to offset  (accepts  positive
       or negative decimal points);


       ccooffffsseett  (experimental)  -  offset for the vectors lines. If coffset is
       used then offset of line is equal to coffset * category value and  off-
       set is used in legend;


       rreeff (experimental) - line justification.


       mmaasskkeedd  -  whether  or  not the raster map layer is to be masked by the
       current mask (see manual entry _r_._m_a_s_k
        for more information on the mask);


       ssttyyllee - the line style allows the vectors to  be  dashed  in  different
       patterns.   This is done by typing a series of numbers (0's and 1's) in
       a desired sequence or pattern.  Blanks  and  non-digit  characters  are
       recognized  as  0's.  Using  0 would allow the colors of the raster map
       layer (or the background color if no raster map layer was selected)  to
       show through;


       lliinnee__ccaatt - which category should be plotted (default is all);


       llaabbeell - for description in vlegend. Default is: map(mapset);


       llppooss  -  position  vector  is plotted in legend. If lpos is 0 then this
       vector is omitted in legend. If more vectors used the  same  lpos  then
       their  symbols in legend are merged and label for first vector is used.


       ppaatt - full path to pattern file. Pattern file contains header and  sim-
       ple  PS  commands.   It  is similar to EPS but more limited, that means
       that each pattern file is EPS file but EPS files are not  usually  use-
       full  as  pattern  files because contain restricted commands. Color and
       width of patterns is set by aaccoolloorr and ppwwiiddtthh until it  is  overwritten
       in  pattern file. Currently the only way to create pattern file is text
       editor. Example of pattern file:
       %!PS-Adobe-2.0 EPSF-1.2
       %%BoundingBox: 0 0 10 10
       newpath
       5 0 moveto
       5 10 lineto
       stroke



       ssccaallee - pattern scale


       ppwwiiddtthh - pattern line width, width is used by pattern until  the  width
       is overwritten in pattern file.






       This  example  would paint a map of the vector map layer named _s_t_r_e_a_m_s.
       These streams would be a total of 3 pixels wide (the inner  two  pixels
       blue  and  the  outer  highlight  pixel white).  The map would not show
       streams outside of the current mask. Only streams of category 2 will be
       plotted.  In legend appeares label 'Streams - category 2'.

            vveeccttoorr streams

       Changes the amount of talking _p_s_._m_a_p will do.
       USAGE: vveerrbboossee [0|1|2]

       A  higher  value implies more chatter.  The default is 2.  This example
       sets the amount of chatter to a minimum.

            vveerrbboossee 0




vvlleeggeenndd

       The  default  location  is  immediately below the legend containing the
       scale, grid and region information, starting at the left  edge  of  the
       map.   If  the _w_h_e_r_e instruction is present and _y is less than or equal
       to zero, the vector legend will be  positioned  immediately  below  the
       map, starting _x inches from the left edge of the page.


       This  example  prints  the  vector legend immediately below the map and
       starting 4.5 inches from the left edge of the page, using a 12/72  inch
       Helvetica font.
