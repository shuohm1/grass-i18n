       _v_._s_u_r_f_._r_s_t

       This  program  interpolates  the  z-values from vector data (e.g., con-
       tours, isolines) given in a vector file named _i_n_p_u_t to  grid  cells  in
       the  output  raster  file  _e_l_e_v  representing  a surface. As an option,
       simultaneously  with  interpolation,  topographic   parameters   slope,
       aspect,  profile  curvature  (measured  in  the  direction  of steepest
       slope), tangential curvature (measured in the direction of a tangent to
       contour  line) or mean curvature are computed and saved as raster files
       specified by the options _s_l_o_p_e_, _a_s_p_e_c_t_,  _p_c_u_r_v_,  _t_c_u_r_v_,  _m_c_u_r_v  respec-
       tively.  If  _-_d  flag  is  set  the program outputs partial derivatives
       fx,fy,fxx,fyy,fxy instead of slope,  aspect,  profile,  tangential  and
       mean  curvatures  respectively.  If the input data have time stamp, the
       program creates time stamp for all output files.

       User can define a raster file named _m_a_s_k_m_a_p, which will be  used  as  a
       mask.  The  interpolation  is skipped for cells which have zero or NULL
       value in mask. NULL values will be assigned to these cells in all  out-
       put  raster  files.  Data  points  are checked for identical points and
       points that are closer to each other than the given _d_m_i_n  are  removed.
       Additional points are used for interpolation between each 2 points on a
       line if the distance between  them  is  greater  than  specified  _d_m_a_x.
       Parameter  _z_m_u_l_t  allows  user to rescale the z-values (useful e.g. for
       transformation of elevations given in  feet  to  meters,  so  that  the
       proper values of slopes and curvatures can be computed).

       Regularized spline with tension is used for the interpolation. The _t_e_n_-
       _s_i_o_n parameter tunes the character of the resulting surface  from  thin
       plate to membrane. For noisy data, it is possible to define a smoothing
       parameter _s_m_o_o_t_h_.  With the smoothing parameter set to zero  (_s_m_o_o_t_h_=_0)
       the  resulting  surface  passes  exactly  through the data points. When
       smoothing parameter is used, it is possible to output  site  file  _d_e_v_i
       containing deviations of the resulting surface from the given data.

       If  the  number  of given points is greater than _s_e_g_m_a_x, segmented pro-
       cessing is used . The region is split into rectangular  segments,  each
       having  less  than _s_e_g_m_a_x points and interpolation is performed on each
       segment of the region. To ensure the smooth connection of segments  the
       interpolation function for each segment is computed using the points in
       given segment and the points in its neighborhood which are in the rect-
       angular  window  surrounding  the  given  segment. The number of points
       taken for interpolation is controlled by _n_p_m_i_n, the value of which must
       be  larger than _s_e_g_m_a_x which represent the quad tree used for segmenta-
       tion and overlapping neighborhoods from  which  additional  points  for
       interpolation  on each segment were taken.  Anisotropic surfaces can be
       interpolated setting anisotropy angle _t_h_e_t_a and scaling factor  _s_c_a_l_e_x.
       The  program  writes several important values to history file of raster
       map _e_l_e_v.

NNOOTTEESS
       _v_._s_u_r_f_._r_s_t uses regularized spline with tensionfor  interpolation  from
       vector  data. Additional points are used for interpolation between each
       2 points on a line if the distance between them is greater than  speci-
       fied  _d_m_a_x.  If _d_m_a_x is small (less than cell size) the number of added
       data  points  can  be  vary   large   and   slow   down   interpolation
       significantly.   The  implementation has a segmentation procedure based
       on quadtrees which enhances the efficiency for large data  sets.Special
       color tables are created by the program for output raster files.

       Topographic  parameters  are  computed  directly from the interpolation
       function so that the important relationships between  these  parameters
       are  preserved.  The  equations for computation of these parameters and
       their interpretation is described  in  (Mitasova  and  Hofierka  1993).
       Slopes  and  aspect  are  computed  in  degrees (0-90 and 1-360 respec-
       tively).  The aspect raster file has value 0  assigned  to  flat  areas
       (with  slope  less  than  0.1%)  and  to singular points with undefined
       aspect. Aspect points downslope and is 90 to  the  North,  180  to  the
       West,  270  to the South and 360 to the East, the values increase coun-
       terclockwise. Curvatures are positive for convex and negative for  con-
       cave  areas.  Singular  points  with undefined curvatures have assigned
       zero values.

       _T_e_n_s_i_o_n and _s_m_o_o_t_hing allow user to tune the  surface  character.   For
       most landscape scale applications the default should work fine.The pro-
       gram gives warning when significant overshoots appear in the  resulting
       surface and higher tension or smoothing should be used.

       While  it  is  possible to automatize the selection of suitable _t_e_n_s_i_o_n
       and _s_m_o_o_t_hing, it has not been done yet, so here are some  hints  which
       may  help  to choose the proper parameters if the results look "weird".
       It is useful to know that the method is scale dependent and the _t_e_n_s_i_o_n
       works  as  a rescaling parameter (high _t_e_n_s_i_o_n "increases the distances
       between the points" and reduces the range of impact of each point,  low
       _t_e_n_s_i_o_n  "decreases  the  distance" and the points influence each other
       over longer range). Surface with  _t_e_n_s_i_o_n set too high behaves  like  a
       membrane (rubber sheet stretched over the data points) with peak or pit
       ("crater") in each given point and everywhere  else  the  surface  goes
       rapidly  to  trend.  If digitized contours are used as input data, high
       tension can cause artificial waves along contours.  Lower  tension  and
       higher smoothing is suggested for such a case.

       Surface  with  _t_e_n_s_i_o_n set too low behaves like a stiff steel plate and
       overshoots can appear in areas with rapid change of gradient  and  seg-
       mentation can be visible. Increase tension should solve the problems.

       There  are  two options how _t_e_n_s_i_o_n can be applied in relation to _d_n_o_r_m
       (dnorm rescales the coordinates depending on the average  data  density
       so  that  the size of segments with _s_e_g_m_a_x_=40 points is around 1 - this
       ensures the numerical stability of the computation):

       1. Default (used also in s.surf.rst): the given _t_e_n_s_i_o_n is  applied  to
       normalized  data (x/_d_n_o_r_m..),  that means that the distances are multi-
       plied (rescaled) by _t_e_n_s_i_o_n_/_d_n_o_r_m. If density  of  points  is  changed,
       e.g.,   by using higher _d_m_i_n, the _d_n_o_r_m changes and _t_e_n_s_i_o_n needs to be
       changed too to get the same result.  Because the _t_e_n_s_i_o_n is applied  to
       normalized  data  its suitable value is usually within the 10-100 range
       and does not depend on the actual scale  (distances)  of  the  original
       data (which can be km for regional applications or cm for field experi-
       ments).

       2. Flag --tt (experimental for s.surf.rst):: The given _t_e_n_s_i_o_n is  applied
       to un-normalized data (rescaled tension = t_e_n_s_i_o_n_*_d_n_o_r_m/1000 is applied
       to normalized data (x/_d_n_o_r_m) and therefore  _d_n_o_r_m cancels out) so  here
       _t_e_n_s_i_o_n  truly  works  as a rescaling parameter.  For regional applica-
       tions with distances between points in km. the suitable tension can  be
       500 or higher, for detailed field scale analysis it can be 0.1. To help
       select how much the data need to be rescaled the program  writes  _d_n_o_r_m
       and rescaled tension=_t_e_n_s_i_o_n_*_d_n_o_r_m/1000 at the beginning of the program
       run. This rescaled _t_e_n_s_i_o_n should be around 20-30.  If it is  lower  or
       higher, the given _t_e_n_s_i_o_n parameter should be changed accordingly.

       The default is a recommended choice, however for the applications where
       the user needs to change density of data and preserve the interpolation
       character the --tt flag can be helpful.

       Anisotropic  data  (e.g.  geologic phenomena) can be interpolated using
       _t_h_e_t_a and _s_c_a_l_e_x defining orientation and ratio  of  the  perpendicular
       axes  put  on  the  longest/shortest side of the feature, respectively.
       _T_h_e_t_a is measured in degrees from East, counterclockwise. _S_c_a_l_e_x  is  a
       ratio  of  axes  sizes.   Setting _s_c_a_l_e_x in the range 0-1, you will get
       pattern prolonged in the direction defined by _t_h_e_t_a. _S_c_a_l_e_x  value  0.5
       means  that your feature is approximatelly 2 times longer in the direc-
       tion of _t_h_e_t_a than in the  perpendicular  direction.   _S_c_a_l_e_x  value  2
       means that axes ratio is reverse and you will get pattern perpendicular
       to the previous example. Please note that  anisotropy  option  has  not
       been  extensively  tested and may include bugs - if there are problems,
       please    report    to    GRASS     bugtracker     (accessible     from
       http://grass.itc.it/).


       The program gives warning when significant overshoots appear and higher
       tension should be used. However, with tension too  high  the  resulting
       surface  changes  its behavior to membrane (rubber sheet stretched over
       the data points resulting in a peak or pit  in  each  given  point  and
       everywhere  else the surface goes rapidly to trend). Also smoothing can
       be used to reduce the overshoots.

       For data with values changing over several  magnitudes  (sometimes  the
       concentration  or  density data) it is suggested to interpolate the log
       of the values rather than the original ones.

       The program checks the numerical stability of the algorithm  by  compu-
       tating  the  values  in  given  points, and prints the root mean square
       deviation (rms) found into the history file of  raster  map  _e_l_e_v.  For
       computation  with  smoothing  set  to  0.  rms should be 0. Significant
       increase in _t_e_n_s_i_o_n is suggested if the rms is  unexpectedly  high  for
       this  case. With smoothing parameter greater than zero the surface will
       not pass exactly through the data points and the higher  the  parameter
       the  closer the surface will be to the trend. The rms then represents a
       measure of smoothing effect on data. More detailed analysis of  smooth-
       ing effects can be performed using the output deviations option.

       The  program  writes  the values of parameters used in computation into
       the comment part of history file _e_l_e_v as well as the  following  values
       which  help to evaluate the results and choose the suitable parameters:
       minimum and maximum z values in the data  file  (zmin_data,  zmax_data)
       and  in  the  interpolated  raster  map (zmin_int, zmax_int), rescaling
       parameter used for normalization (dnorm), which influences the tension.

       If  visible connection of segments appears, the program should be rerun
       with higher _n_p_m_i_n to get more points from  the  neighborhood  of  given
       segment and/or with higher tension.

       When  the  number  of points in a site file is not too large (less than
       800), the user can skip segmentation by setting _s_e_g_m_a_x to the number of
       data points or _s_e_g_m_a_x_=_7_0_0.

       The  program  gives  warning when user wants to interpolate outside the
       rectangle given by minimum and maximum coordinates in the vector  file,
       zoom  into the area where the given data are is suggested in this case.

       When a mask is used, the program takes all points in the  given  region
       for  interpolation, including those in the area which is masked out, to
       ensure proper interpolation along the border of the mask. It  therefore
       does  not  mask  out  the data points, if this is desirable, it must be
       done outside _v_._s_u_r_f_._r_s_t_.

       For          examples           of           applications           see
       http://skagit.meas.ncsu.edu/~helena/gmslab/.

       The  user  must  run  g.region before the program to set the region and
       resolution for interpolation.
