       _g_._a_s_k is designed for shell scripts that need to prompt  the  user  for
       the  name  of  a  data  base file in the user's current GRASS location.
       After _g_._a_s_k is invoked with needed parameters, it will query  the  user
       for  a  file  name  of  the specified _t_y_p_e and _e_l_e_m_e_n_t.  After the user
       responds to this query, the program will write four lines to  the  UNIX
       output file specified by _u_n_i_x_f_i_l_e.

       ttyyppee==_n_a_m_e
              The  type  of  query.   Options  for _n_a_m_e are _o_l_d, _n_e_w, _a_n_y, and
              _m_a_p_s_e_t;  their functions are given  below.   "New",  "any",  and
              "mapset" only look in the user's current mapset.

       oolldd    For  existing  data  files  anywhere in the user's mapset search
              path.

       nneeww    Used to create a new file in the current mapset, which must  not
              already  exist  there (if a file with this name exists there, it
              will not be overwritten).

       aannyy    Creates a file in the current  mapset,  which  may  or  may  not
              already  exist  there.   If  a file with this name exists in the
              current mapset, it will be overwritten; if not, a new file  with
              this name will be created.

       mmaappsseett For  files that must exist in the current mapset The shell write
              wants the name of a file which  exists  in  the  user's  current
              mapset.  This type would used instead of "old" if the file is to
              be modified.


       pprroommpptt==
              The prompt to be displayed to the user.  If more than one  word,
              the prompt should be enclosed within double quotes ("").

       eelleemmeenntt==_n_a_m_e
              The name of the GRASS data base element (i.e., directory under a
              GRASS mapset) whose files are to be queried.

       ddeesscc==  A short description of the data base element which is meaningful
              to  the  user.   If  description contains more than one word, it
              should be enclosed within double quotes ("").

       uunniixxffiillee==_n_a_m_e
              The name of a UNIX file to store the user's response.  See  next
              section  for what is written to this file and how it can be used
              by shell scripts.


OOUUTTPPUUTT
       Upon receiving the user's response to its  request  for  a  file  name,
       _g_._a_s_k  writes four lines to the specified _u_n_i_x_f_i_l_e; this output file is
       placed in the user's current working directory, unless otherwise speci-
       fied, and contains the following lines: name='_s_o_m_e___n_a_m_e'

       mapset='_s_o_m_e___m_a_p_s_e_t'

       fullname='_s_o_m_e___f_u_l_l_n_a_m_e'

       file='_s_o_m_e___f_u_l_l_p_a_t_h'



       The  output  is  _/_b_i_n_/_s_h  commands to set the variable _n_a_m_e to the file
       name specified by the user  (of  the  _e_l_e_m_e_n_t  and  _t_y_p_e  requested  by
       _g_._a_s_k),  _m_a_p_s_e_t to the GRASS mapset in which this file resides (or will
       be created), _f_u_l_l_n_a_m_e is the name with the mapset embedded in  it,  and
       _f_i_l_e to the full UNIX path name identifying this file.  These variables
       may be set in the _/_b_i_n_/_s_h as follows: .. uunniixxffiillee



       The . is a shell command which means read the _u_n_i_x_f_i_l_e and execute  the
       commands  found there.  It is NOT part of the _u_n_i_x_f_i_l_e name and MUST be
       followed by a space.

NNOOTTEESS
       The user may choose to simply hit the return key and not enter  a  file
       name.  If this happens the variables will be set as follows: name=

       mapset=

       fullname=

       file=



       The following is a way to test for this case:
                 if [ ! "$file" ]
                 then
                      exit
                 fi
