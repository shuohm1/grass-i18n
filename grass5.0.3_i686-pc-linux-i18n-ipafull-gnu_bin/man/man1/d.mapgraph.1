       _d_._m_a_p_g_r_a_p_h  draws  graphics  that  are  described  in  standard   input
       (default)  or  the  UNIX  input  file _n_a_m_e. If commands are entered via
       standard input, a _c_t_r_l_-_d is used to signal the end of input  to  _d_._m_a_p_-
       _g_r_a_p_h.  This program performs essentially the same function as _d_._g_r_a_p_h;
       however, point locations are specified to _d_._m_a_p_g_r_a_p_h in the  geographic
       coordinate  system  of the user's current mapset and location (i.e., in
       map coordinates), rather than in graphics display screen coordinates.


       The program can be run interactively or  non-interactively.   The  user
       can run the program completely non-interactively by specifying the name
       of a file containing _d_._m_a_p_g_r_a_p_h graphics commands and the values of all
       needed  parameters  on the command line.  The user can instead elect to
       run the program partially interactively, by specifying any/all  of  the
       parameters  _e_x_c_e_p_t  the  graphics  iinnppuutt==_n_a_m_e  parameter on the command
       line.  In this case, _d_._m_a_p_g_r_a_p_h will expect the user  to  input  _d_._m_a_p_-
       _g_r_a_p_h  graphics  commands  from standard input (i.e., the keyboard) and
       will (silently) prompt the user for these  graphics  commands.   Alter-
       nately, the user can simply type dd..mmaappggrraapphh on the command line, and be
       prompted for the values of all parameters (the  user  can  still  input
       graphics  commands  from  an input file using this form.) In this case,
       the user is presented with the standard GRASS _p_a_r_s_e_r interface.

              the  full path name of the file if not in the current directory.
              If no file name is  given,  commands  are  taken  from  standard
              input.

       ccoolloorr==_n_a_m_e
              Starting color desired for graphics.
              Options:  red,  orange,  yellow,  green,  blue,  indigo, violet,
              magenta, brown, gray, white, and black.
              Default: _w_h_i_t_e

       _d_._m_a_p_g_r_a_p_h is used for drawing simple graphics on top  of  map  layers.
       The coordinate system used by _d_._m_a_p_g_r_a_p_h is the same as that of the map
       layer displayed in the active display frame on the graphics monitor (or
       that of the user's current region, if no map is displayed).


       The graphics language is simple and uses the following commands:

       ## _c_o_m_m_e_n_t
              A line of comment which is ignored in the processing.

       mmoovvee _x_p_o_s _y_p_o_s
              The  current  location  is  updated  to  _x_p_o_s _y_p_o_s (where these,
              respectively,  are  the  easting  and  northing  of   geographic
              coordinates  stated  in  the map coordinate system of the user's
              current GRASS location, falling within the  current  region  and
              active frame).  If unspecified by the user, the current location
              becomes (0,0).  If, as most likely, the point (0,0)  falls  out-
              side of the user's current region, graphics drawn there will not
              appear in the graphics frame.


       Note: use _g_._r_e_g_i_o_n to obtain the coordinates of current location.   Use
       _d_._w_h_e_r_e  to  obtain  specific  map coordinates of various points on the
       raster map displayed in the active frame.
       Note: there must be a space between _x_p_o_s and _y_p_o_s.

       ddrraaww _x_p_o_s ypos
              A line is drawn in the current color from the  current  location
              to  the  new  location _x_p_o_s _y_p_o_s, which then becomes the current
              location.  _x_p_o_s and _y_p_o_s are (respectively) an easting and  nor-
              thing  stated in the map coordinate system of the user's current
              GRASS location, and located within the user's current geographic
              region and active frame.


       Note: there must be a space between _x_p_o_s and _y_p_o_s.

       ccoolloorr _c_o_l_o_r
              Sets  the current color to that stated.  Color options are: _r_e_d,
              _o_r_a_n_g_e, _y_e_l_l_o_w, _g_r_e_e_n, _b_l_u_e,  _i_n_d_i_g_o,  _v_i_o_l_e_t,  _m_a_g_e_n_t_a_,  _b_r_o_w_n,
              _g_r_a_y, _w_h_i_t_e, and _b_l_a_c_k.

       ssiizzee _x_p_e_r _y_p_e_r
              Subsequent text will be drawn such that the text is _x_p_e_r percent
              of the display frame's width and _y_p_e_r  percent  of  the  display
              frame  height.   If  not  specified  by  the user, the text size
              becomes 5 percent of the active frame's width and 5  percent  of
              the frame's height.  This is equivalent to entering ssiizzee 55 55.

       tteexxtt _l_i_n_e_-_o_f_-_t_e_x_t
              The  stated text is drawn at the current location using the cur-
              rent color and the current size.

       iiccoonn _t_y_p_e _s_i_z_e _x _y
              Draws an icon of types o, x, or + with specified size  at  loca-
              tion x,y.  Note: type o designates a square.

       ppoollyyggoonn
               _x_p_o_s _y_p_o_s

               _x_p_o_s _y_p_o_s




              The map coordinates appearing on lines beneath the word _p_o_l_y_g_o_n,
              one pair per line, circumscribe a polygon which is to be  filled
              with the current color.


NNOOTTEESS
       _d_._m_a_p_g_r_a_p_h  is identical to the _d_._g_r_a_p_h command, except for the differ-
       ence in coordinate systems used.


       _d_._m_a_p_g_r_a_p_h will complain if the user enters something to standard input
       that it does not understand.  Blank lines in the input file will result
       in this error message.
