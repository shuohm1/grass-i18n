       Use _d_._a_r_e_a to draw filled polygons from a vector map to the GRASS  dis-
       play.   Using,  the "_-_f" flag, the program will cycle through the stan-
       dard GRASS named colors, overriding any _f_i_l_l_c_o_l_o_r argument.  Otherwise,
       the color used for filling polygons is as specified.


       The  arguments  for  _f_i_l_l_c_o_l_o_r and _l_i_n_e_c_o_l_o_r can be any named X11 color
       (as found in grass5/etc/rgb.txt),  a  hexidecimal  color  string  (like
       "AFDF00"),  or an RGB triplet specified as "rgb(_r_e_d _g_r_e_e_n _b_l_u_e)".  Hex-
       idecimal color strings must be six characters where  each  pair  repre-
       sents the red, green and blue colors, respectively.  RGB values must be
       between 0 and 255 for each component.  Do not use any separator besides
       a space between the RGB numbers.


       The  user  can  optionally  choose  to  restrict  drawing operations to
       selected polygons by specifying one or more area category numbers using
       the _c_a_t_n_u_m argument.

NNOOTTEESS
       When  run  on the command line, any X11 color name containing spaces or
       any rgb(...) specification must be quoted to  prevent  the  shell  from
       splitting it into separate arguments.


       The  routine for handling holes in polygons is relatively slow.  There-
       fore, large maps containing a large number of holes will suffer a  sig-
       nificant performance penalty.

       It  is  the  intention of GRASS developers to create a better mechanism
       for persistent storage of vector drawing instructions in the future.

BBUUGGSS
       The program does not properly clip areas to match the  current  display
       extent (HHEELLPP WWAANNTTEEDD).

       There  is a slight disagreement between the output of d.vect and _d_._a_r_e_a
       regarding the map coordinate to  screen  coordinate  conversion.   This
       leads to undesirable results when both are used.
