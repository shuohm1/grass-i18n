              palette,  and draw all boundaries in black. The palette is simi-
              lar to the GRASS named colors, but replaces white and black with
              other colors.

              Color  desired for filling polygons. May be specified as a stan-
              dard grass color name, or as an RGB triplet  (e.g.  80:198:255).
              Fill  can be disabled by specifying a color of "none".  Default:
              white

       lliinneeccoolloorr
              Color desired for drawing area boundaries.  May be specified  as
              a  standard  grass  color  name,  or  as  an  RGB  triplet (e.g.
              127:127:127).  Line drawing can  be  disabled  by  specifying  a
              color of "none".  Default: black

       ccaattnnuumm List  of  category  numbers  to  restrict which areas are drawn.
              Ignored if either the _-_r flag or the _l_e_g_e_n_d options are used.

       lleeggeenndd Name of a legend file specifying what color to use for each cat-
              egory  (see below). If "-" is specified, the legend will be read
              from standard input.  Default: none

       Use _d_._v_e_c_t_._a_r_e_a to draw labelled areas from a vector map to  the  GRASS
       display.   Using, the "_-_r" flag, the program will cycle through a small
       color palette, overriding any _f_i_l_l_c_o_l_o_r or _l_i_n_e_c_o_l_o_r  argument.   If  a
       _l_e_g_e_n_d  file  is specified, it will be used.  Otherwise, the color used
       for filling areas is as specified.


       The _f_i_l_l_c_o_l_o_r argument may be any of the standard named  GRASS  colors,
       or  and  RGB  (red, green, blue) triplet.  An RGB triplet must have the
       form _:_:_<_;_n_u_m_>_; where _n_u_m is between 0 and 255.  If "none" is specified,
       no  fill  will  be done.  Specifying "none" does not make sense for the
       random color option, since it always draws lines in black.


       The _l_i_n_e_c_o_l_o_r argument specifies the color  to  use  for  drawing  area
       boundary  lines.  It has the same format as _f_i_l_l_c_o_l_o_r, and also accepts
       the "none" color to disable line drawing.


       An optional list of category numbers may  be  used  to  restrict  which
       areas  are drawn (only valid with the _f_i_l_l_c_o_l_o_r and _l_i_n_e_c_o_l_o_r options).


       More control can be had by creating a _l_e_g_e_n_d file.  At the time of this
       writing,  GRASS  does  not have any management functions for specifying
       how vectors should be drawn, so this file must be  created  by  "hand".
       The easiest way to create such a file, is to copy the category file for
       the vector map, and edit it to contain color specifications.  The  for-
       mat  of  the  _l_e_g_e_n_d  file is _c_a_t_e_g_o_r_y _r_e_d _g_r_e_e_n _b_l_u_e _[_r_e_d _g_r_e_e_n _b_l_u_e_],
       with one entry per line.  The first RGB color specifies the fill color,
       while  the optional second one specifies the boundary line color.  If a
       category for a map is not included in this file, it will not  be  drawn
       unless  there  is  a  special  "default"  entry  with a category of -1.
       Boundary lines are not drawn unless either a boundary color  is  speci-
       fied for the category, or there is a default boundary color.  Using the
       keyword "none" for either _f_i_l_l_c_o_l_o_r or _l_i_n_e_c_o_l_o_r in conjunction with  a
       legend will override drawing fill or boundary lines.

              -1 255 255 255 127 127 127

              1  210 198 168

              5  168 198 220




       In the above, all labelled areas will be drawn in white (255, 255, 255)
       with dark gray boundaries (127, 127, 127) except those labelled as cat-
       egories  1  or  5.   If the "default" entry had been omitted, then only
       areas labelled 1 or 5 would have been drawn.  Since the entries  for  1
       and  5  don't specify a color for boundary lines, no boundary lines are
       drawn.


       One may place comments on any line in the legend file  by  starting  it
       with  a  non-numeric character ('#' is a good choice).  Empty lines are
       ignored.

NNOOTTEESS
       It is expected that the legend specification aspect of this module will
       change  when  an  infrastructure  for managing vector drawing styles is
       implemented.
