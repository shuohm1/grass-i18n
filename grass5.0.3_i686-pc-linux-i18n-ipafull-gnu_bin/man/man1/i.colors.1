       _i_._c_o_l_o_r_s allows the user to interactively assign red, green,  and  blue
       colors  to the band files in an imagery group while viewing the display
       of the combined bands on the graphics monitor.


       The user is asked to select an imagery group.  Band files in the  group
       that are currently assigned to the red, green, and blue color bands are
       displayed along the left edge of the user's graphics display frame, and
       a  composite  image of these bands is displayed in the right portion of
       the display frame.  A small matrix appears in the lower left portion of
       the  display frame, and reflects current red, green, and blue band file
       color assignments.  Red, green, and blue color boxes appear next to the
       names  of  the  image  band files to which they are currently assigned.
       The user can change current color assignments  by  clicking  the  mouse
       cursor beside desired color assignments.


       A  menu  along  the bottom of the graphics display frame indicates that
       the user can also replot and enlarge the composite image on display, or
       quit the program, by clicking the mouse cursor on the desired option.


       The  GRASS  program  _i_._g_r_o_u_p can also be used to assign red, green, and
       blue colors to imagery group band files.

       This program is not yet complete.  To assign colors to an imagery group
       use the GRASS program _i_._g_r_o_u_p.


       This  program  is  interactive  and requires no command line arguments.
       The user must be running a graphics monitor to use this program.


       To store color composite output into  a  map,  the  user  will  utilize
       _i_._c_o_m_p_o_s_i_t_e.
