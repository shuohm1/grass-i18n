       This  program  will  fix vector data that were not digitized in correct
       GRASS vector format.  It will create a node at every line crossing, and
       will delete all hanging lines of length less than the specified thresh-
       old.

       --ii     Only do identical line removal pass.

       --ss     Snap nodes.

       --pp     Prompt user for threshold value.

       tthhrreesshhoolldd==_v_a_l_u_e
              Node-snapping threshold value.


NNOOTTEESS
       The user must run _v_._s_u_p_p_o_r_t after running _v_._s_p_a_g to correct the  topol-
       ogy (_d_i_g___p_l_u_s) file.


       _v_._s_p_a_g  generally  deletes  many lines from the input vector map layer.
       Because deleted lines are not eliminated from a vector data (_d_i_g) file,
       but  are  only  marked  as  deleted, the user will probably wish to run
       _v_._c_l_e_a_n on the vector  file  after  running  _v_._s_p_a_g  to  eliminate  any
       deleted lines from the _d_i_g file and decrease its size.

BBUUGGSS
       This  program contains several known bugs.  It will sometimes get stuck
       in a loop in which it creates the same line over and  over  again.   It
       will  occasionally  create an incorrect line.  Users are strongly urged
       to back-up their vector data files before running this alpha version of
       _v_._s_p_a_g.


       Update Note:

       1/93:   For  GRASS  Release  4.1,  the  --ii flag has been added and bugs
       fixed.  It works better than the 4.0 release.

       6/00:  The --ss and --pp flags has been added.  One reason for loop  fixed,
       please report if you get into the loop after this date.
