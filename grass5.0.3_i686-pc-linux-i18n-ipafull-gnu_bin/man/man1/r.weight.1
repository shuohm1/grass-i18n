       _r_._w_e_i_g_h_t  is a language driven raster map overlay program.  It provides
       a means for performing geographical analyses using several raster maps.
       _r_._w_e_i_g_h_t  asks the user to weight (assign numeric values to) the raster
       map categories of interest.  The assignment of weighted values requires
       that the user intimately understand the analysis being undertaken.  How
       important is the slope of the land in comparison with the current  land
       use,  or  the depth to bedrock?  The assignment of values to the land's
       characteristics allows _r_._w_e_i_g_h_t to mix and compare apples and  oranges,
       such as slopes and land uses, and soil types and vegetation.


       _r_._w_e_i_g_h_t  is  a  language-driven  analysis tool.  It responds to worded
       commands typed at the terminal.  Help is always available via  the  one
       word  command:  hheellpp.  Commands available in _r_._w_e_i_g_h_t are listed below.


       Note that raster map names appear in parentheses.  The use of parenthe-
       ses is now optional in _r_._w_e_i_g_h_t.

       In order for _r_._w_e_i_g_h_t to generate raster maps useful for analysis,  the
       user  must  make  a reasonable and defensible request.  While much more
       powerful than _r_._c_o_m_b_i_n_e, _r_._w_e_i_g_h_t is also  more  dangerous.   The  user
       provides  the  necessary  value  judgements  which  are  registered  as
       weights.  Only well-conceived value judgements will result in  defensi-
       ble  results.   We suggest the following approach to a weighted overlay
       analysis:

       STEP 1: BEFORE RUNNING WEIGHT

       a) Define the question to be answered.  e.g.,
              sites suitable for building apartments."

       b) Determine what mapped information is useful for
              answering  the  question.   e.g.,  geology,   soils,   land_use,
              flood_potential.

       c) Based on professional judgement, statistical
              inference,  and  engineering  principals,  assign weights to the
              categories in the chosen raster maps.


       STEP 2: CHOOSE CELL MAPS


       In _r_._w_e_i_g_h_t, use the command _c_h_o_o_s_e to identify up to six  raster  maps
       of interest.



       STEP 3: ASSIGN WEIGHTS


       Using  the  _r_._w_e_i_g_h_t  command _a_s_s_i_g_n, assign specific weights to raster
       map categories.



       STEP 4: SAVE ANALYSIS


       Use the _s_a_v_e command to save a copy of the analysis requested for later
       use.



       STEP 5: RUN ANALYSIS


       Use _e_x_e_c_u_t_e to run the analysis.



       STEP 6: EVALUATE RESULTS


       To  modify  an  existing  analysis  request, use the _r_e_c_o_v_e_r command to
       retrieve the analysis and then go to STEP 3.
