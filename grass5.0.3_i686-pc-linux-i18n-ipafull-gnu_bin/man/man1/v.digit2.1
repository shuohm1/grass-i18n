       The  GRASS  program  _v_._d_i_g_i_t_2  is a menu-driven, highly interactive map
       development program used for inputting analog map  data  into  a  GRASS
       vector format.  _v_._d_i_g_i_t_2 contains programs for vector digitizing, edit-
       ing, labeling, windowing, and converting vector data  to  GRASS  raster
       format.


       _v_._d_i_g_i_t_2 consists of two parts: an initialization procedure, and a mul-
       tiple menu-driven environment.

              The initialization  procedure  involves  choosing  a  digitizer,
              choosing  the  name  of  a vector map layer to digitize, and, if
              needed, registering a map to the digitizing surface.

              The second part of _v_._d_i_g_i_t_2 is a  multiple-menu  environment  in
              which  digitizing,  editing,  labeling,  and  other  options are
              available. It is within this second portion of _v_._d_i_g_i_t_2 that all
              vector creation occurs.

       _v_._d_i_g_i_t_2  was written to optimize digitizing speed and performance.  It
       has a convenient graphic display format and very  convenient  windowing
       capabilities.  Features  are color-coded for ease of identification and
       verification.  Different color schemes may be user-chosen to  customize
       a digitizing session.


       Area,  line,  and  point features may be digitized in both "stream" and
       "point" modes. Both a mouse and a digitizer may be used to perform win-
       dowing  functions.  Labeling and editing are done from within _v_._d_i_g_i_t_2,
       rather than through a separate set of programs.


       _v_._d_i_g_i_t_2 has capabilities that allow users to convert vector map layers
       to  GRASS  raster format, to overlay already existing vector map layers
       onto the feature being digitized, and set a multitude of parameters  to
       customize a digitizing session.


       _v_._d_i_g_i_t_2  may  be  used  with or without a digitizer.  Many options are
       available if no digitizer is used.


       All options available within _v_._d_i_g_i_t_2 are contained within  ten  menus.
       Movement  from  menu  to  menu  is done by chosing the movement options
       specified at the bottom of each menu.
