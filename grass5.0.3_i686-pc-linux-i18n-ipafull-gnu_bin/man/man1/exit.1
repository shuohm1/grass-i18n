       The  _e_x_i_t command ends the user's current GRASS session and returns the
       user to the directory in which he was working prior to entering  GRASS.
       When  the  user  exits GRASS, he is asked whether he wishes to save the
       files and data stored under  his  current  mapset,  and  (if  maps  are
       present)  whether  the  user  wishes  to selectively remove map layers,
       before exiting the system.  By default,  if  the  user  presses  RETURN
       without  responding  to these questions, all maps in the user's current
       mapset are saved.  However, because such maps can consume much  storage
       space on the computer, the user should remove any unneeded files before
       exiting.  (The user can also remove  data  before  attempting  to  _e_x_i_t
       GRASS using the _g_._r_e_m_o_v_e command.)


       Before  typing  _e_x_i_t,  the  polite  user should remember to release the
       graphics display monitor (using the command dd..mmoonn --rr) for use by  other
       GRASS users. Otherwise, the display device may be locked for use by the
       user, even though the user has exited GRASS, until  another  user  runs
       _d_._m_o_n and unlocks this monitor for others' use.


       Each time the user re-enters GRASS, the variables described in _g_._g_i_s_e_n_v
       are re-set. If the user wishes to change the mapset, location, or  data
       base on which he is working (i.e., those affected by any GRASS programs
       running during the user's current GRASS session), the  user  must  _e_x_i_t
       GRASS and then re-enter GRASS and specify a different mapset, location,
       and/or data base location on the GRASS start-up page. When the user re-
       enters  GRASS,  these  variable settings (the current mapset, location,
       and data base) are set by default to those used in the user's  previous
       GRASS session, unless changed by the user.

NNOOTTEESS
       This  program requires no command line arguments; the user simply types
       eexxiitt on the command line to exit GRASS.
