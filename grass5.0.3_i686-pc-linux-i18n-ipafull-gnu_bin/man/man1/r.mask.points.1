       rr..mmaasskk..ppooiinnttss  filters a list of points based on the current region and
       current mask.  The point list consists of lines which have the  follow-
       ing format
            easting        northing  [text]
                         .
                         .
                         .
            easting        northing  [text]

       The  eastings and northings define points in the coordinate space. Each
       line is examined to determine if the point  falls  within  the  current
       region,  current mask (if any), and optionally an additional raster map
       that acts as a secondary mask. If the point falls outside  the  current
       region  or falls in a grid cell that has value zero (either in the cur-
       rent mask, or the specified mask file), then the entire  line  is  sup-
       pressed.  Otherwise it is printed exactly as it is input.  There may be
       arbitrary text following the coordinate pairs and this text  is  output
       as well.

       --rr     Coordinates are reversed: north east


       Normal  input  has  the  east  first  and the north second. This option
       allows the order of the coordinates to be north first and east next.

       mmaasskk==_n_a_m_e
              Raster map used to mask points


       This parameter is optional. If not specified, then the points are  mask
       by  the  default  mask  (if there is one). If it is specified, then the
       points are mask by this layer as well as the default mask.

       iinnppuutt==_n_a_m_e
              Unix input containing point list


       If not specified it is assumed that the user will either  redirect  the
       input from a file:


       rr..mmaasskk..ppooiinnttss < file



       or pipe the results from some other process (e.g., a DBMS query) into
        _r_._m_a_s_k_._p_o_i_n_t_s


       some_process | rr..mmaasskk..ppooiinnttss




       ffss==_c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r
              Input field separator character


       If  the coordinates are not separated by white space, but by some other
       character, this option specifies that  character.  For  example,  if  a
       colon is used between the east and north, then
        _r_._m_a_s_k_._._p_o_i_n_t can be told this by:


        rr..mmaasskk..ppooiinnttss ffss==_:

       Lines  that make it through the filtering are output intact. This means
       that if the coordinates are reversed they will remain reversed on  out-
       put.  If there is a field separator, it will also be output.
