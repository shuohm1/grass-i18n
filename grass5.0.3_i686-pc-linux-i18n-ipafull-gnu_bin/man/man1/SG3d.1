       SG3d  is a tool for viewing a data surface  in  three  dimensions using
       GRASS  on Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.  At  startup,  one  graphics
       window and several  interface  windows are  visible.   Other  interface
       windows  pop up when their appropriate toggle button is clicked in  the
       Menus  panel.  To hide  the pop up windows, click again on their toggle
       button in the Menus panel - using the Quit or  Close  options  from the
       window  manager's  menu  bar  will cause the program to exit.

                 Raster file(s) for Color (1 or 3 files). If three files
                 are  given,  the  first  will  be used for the red com-
                 ponent, the second for  the  green  component  and  the
                 third  for  the blue component. When using three files,
                 each file must contain values in the range 0 - 255.

       If  the user simply types SG3d without  specifying  parameter values on
       the command line, the program will prompt the user to enter these.

       Environment variables SG3D_WIDTH and SG3D_HEIGHT  may be set to  define
       the  width  and  height  (in pixels) of the graphics window at startup.
       All SG3d windows may  be  resized  using the  window  manager's  normal
       controls  at  any  time.   Text  in the control panels is not scalable,
       however,  so  the  text will disappear if the panel is sized too small.


       Before  starting the program, check the resolution and dimen- sions  of
       the current GRASS region.  The  current resolution will  determine  the
       best  resolution  available  in  SG3d.   For speed,  the  entire raster
       file is loaded into memory, along with vertex color and  other  surface
       information   needed   for  lighting  calculations.  Thus, large dimen-
       sions such as 1000 rows x 1000 columns may cause memory problems.  SG3d
       uses  12  bytes   of  memory  for  each vertex, therefore a 1000 x 1000
       image would require 12 megabytes for data alone.


       The GRASS text window is used by SG3d to issue  prompts   and  warnings
       and  to  input filenames.  Therefore, after starting the program, place
       the GRASS text window  where  it  can  be seen and typed into.


       Any sliders and dials used in the control panels have  a  FINE  ADJUST-
       MENT:   Hold   down  the Ctrl key while manipulating the dial or slider
       for fine control.


       Full documentation detailing the action associated with each control is
       available in the tutorial.

BBUUGGSS
       Sometimes  very  small  holes  will  appear  in the  surface.   If they
       appear as points when drawing polygons with grid over- laid, the bug is
       in the Graphics Library and  it  should  be fixed in future versions of
       IRIX.  If the holes appear along an edge of a polygon, it is apparently
       due  to  the   way  non- planar  polygons  are  interpreted.   In  this
       case, drawing using the triangulate  option  should  make   the   holes
       disap- pear.
