       _d_._w_h_e_r_e is an _i_n_t_e_r_a_c_t_i_v_e program  that  allows  the  user,  using  the
       pointing device (mouse), to identify the geographic coordinates associ-
       ated with point locations within the current geographic region  in  the
       active display frame on the graphics monitor.


       If  the  user runs _d_._w_h_e_r_e without specifying the name of a spheroid on
       the command line, each mouse click will output the easting and northing
       of the point currently located beneath the mouse pointer.  A mouse-but-
       ton menu is presented so the user knows which mouse buttons to use. The
       output is always printed to the terminal screen; if the output is redi-
       rected into a file, it will be written to the file as well.


       Mouse buttons:
            Left:   where am i
            Middle: draw to/from here
            Right:  quit this

       The left mouse button prints the coordinates at the selected point, the
       middle mouse button allows to query two points (they are connected by a
       line for convenience). By using the right mouse button  the  module  is
       left.

   FFllaagg::
       --11     Only one mouse click is executed.
              This  option  is  provided  for shell scripts and programs which
              want to obtain only one point from the user. The output is  only
              written to stdout, unless redirected into a file. The geographic
              location and mouse button pressed are output.

       --dd     Output lat/long in decimal degree

       This program uses the current  geographic  region  setting  and  active
       frame.   It  is not necessary, although useful, to have displayed a map
       in the current frame before running _d_._w_h_e_r_e.  The  _-_d  flag  allows  to
       optionally  output  latitude/longitude  coordinates  pair(s) in decimal
       degree rather than DD:MM:SS format. In other projections  the  flag  is
       silently ignored.
