       r.random.cells generates a random sets of cells that are at least  dis-
       tance apart. The cells are numbered from 1 to the numbers of cells gen-
       erated. Random cells will not be generated in areas masked off.

       -q This flag prevents the program from sending a verbose description to
       standard output of what the program is doing.

       output Output map: Random cells. Each random cell has a unique non-zero
       cell value ranging from 1 to the number of cells generated. The heuris-
       tic  for  this  algorithm  is to randomly pick cells until there are no
       cells outside of the chosen cell's buffer of radius distance.

       distance Input value(s) [default 0.0]: distance determines the  minimum
       distance the centers of the random cells will be apart.

       seed  Input  value  [default:  random]:  Specifies the random seed that
       r.random.cells will use to generate the cells. If the  random  seed  is
       not given, r.random.cells will get a seed from the process ID number.

       The  original purpose for this program was to generate independent ran-
       dom samples of cells in a study area. The distance value is the  amount
       of  spatial  autocorrelation  for  the map being studied. The amount of
       spatial autocorrelation can be determined by using r.2Dcorrelogram with
       r.2Dto1D, or r.1Dcorrelogram. With distance set to zero, the output map
       will number each non-masked cell from 1 to  the  number  of  non-masked
       cells in the study region.

       Random Field Software for GRASS by Chuck Ehlschlaeger



       As  part  of my dissertation, I put together several programs that help
       GRASS (4.1 and beyond) develop uncertainty models of  spatial  data.  I
       hope  you  find  it  useful  and dependable. The following papers might
       clarify their use:
