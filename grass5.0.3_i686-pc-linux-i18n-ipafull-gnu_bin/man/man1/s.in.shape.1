       The  _s_._i_n_._s_h_a_p_e  module imports point and multipoint themed ESRI shape-
       files into a GRASS site_lists.

       _s_._i_n_._s_h_a_p_e can be run with command line options as follows:

       ss..iinn..sshhaappee [ --ll ] [ --zz ] [ --mm ] iinn==_n_a_m_e [aattttrriibbuuttee==_a_t_t_r_i_b_u_t_e  _c_a_t_e_g_o_r_y]

       Alternatively, an interactive interface can be started:

       ss..iinn..sshhaappee

       In  this case, the user will be prompted for parameter values using the
       standard GRASS user interface described in the manual entry for _p_a_r_s_e_r.

FFEEAATTUURREESS
       Grass  files  created  have the name extracted from the basename of the
       shapefile.

       All the fields in the associated dbf file are imported, but  those  not
       recognised  as INTEGER, DOUBLE OR STRING are simply recorded as INTEGER
       with a common value of  zero.  This  is  a  place-holder  for  possibly
       improved type support in the future.

       A  field  may be chosen as the attribute field, or if not, a sequential
       ID field is created.

       Multipoint themes are imported with individual points being each  given
       a  separate  record,  but  the original record number is preserved in a
       special field. It is always the first (after the attribute).

       If a measure field is defined in the input theme, this is recorded in a
       special  field.  It  will  be the second if present. A module or script
       using these sites lists is expected to know if this field  is  present.
       This fact is not recorded.

       An  optional  height record for 3d points can be stored if present as a
       third dimension.

FFLLAAGGSS
       --ll

       --zz List the fields contained in the DBF file associated with the  input
       shapefile, then exit.

       Include  a height with each record. The height will only be recorded if
       this flag is set, and then will always be given. If the input data does
       not  contain a height field, a constant value is set, which defaults to
       0. The default can be over-ridden with the _h_e_i_g_h_t option -  see  below.
       --mm  Include  a  field in the sites file with the measure field from the
       input theme. This is only used if the input theme defines  this  field,
       aanndd  the user specifies this flag. Otherwise it is ignored. If present,
       the measure field will be the second field.

       iinn==_n_a_m_e Name of input shape file. Provide a full path name or the  name
       of  a  file  in the current directory.  Any of the full pathname, base-
       name, or prefix only will suffice.  hheeiigghhtt==_z_-_v_a_l_u_e  In  the  event  you
       select  the  --zz option, aanndd there is no in-built height field (zval) in
       the input file, this can provide a constant height value. Otherwise  it
       is  ignored  if  given.   aattttrriibbuuttee==_a___n_a_m_e Name of the field in the dbf
       file to use as the attribute in the sites list. Defaults to  a  sequen-
       tial  index  if  no  attribute  field is given, or the given field is a
       string field.

       The projection must be set in the mapset before input.

       Some site maps do not display all markers.

       The time stamp facility does not appear to work at present.
