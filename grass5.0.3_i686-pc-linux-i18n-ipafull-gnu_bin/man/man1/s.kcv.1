       _s_._k_c_v  randomly  divides  a  sites  lists  into  _k sets  of  test/train
       data  (for  kk-fold  ccross vvalidation).  Test  partitions  are  mutually
       exclusive.  That  is,  a site will appear in only  one  test  partition
       and  _k_-_1 training  partitions.  The  program  generates  a random point
       using the selected random number generator and then finds  the  closest
       site to it.  This site is removed from the candidate list (meaning that
       it will not be selected for any other test  set)   and  saved   in  the
       first  test  partition file.  This is repeated until enough points have
       been selected for the test partition.  The  number  of   sites   chosen
       for  test partitions depends upon the number of sites available and the
       number of partitions chosen (this number is made as consistent as  pos-
       sible while ensuring that all sites will be chosen  for testing).  This
       process of filling up a test partition is done _k times.

       kk=_v_a_l_u_e            Positive integer  value  indicating  the  number  of

       ssiitteess=_n_a_m_e          Name  of  a  sites  file to store random points in.


       Test/train pairs are saved as sites list using _n_a_m_e as a basename. Test
       sites  are saved in _n_a_m_e-test._i while training sites are saved in _n_a_m_e-
       train._i, where _i ranges from zero to _k_.

NNOOTTEESS
       Existing files are silently overwritten.


       An ideal random sites generator will follow a Poisson dis  only  be  as
       random as the  original  sites.   This  program simply divides sites up
       in a random manner.


       Be  warned  that  random number generation occurs  over  the  intervals
       defined by the current region.


       This program may not work properly with Lat-long data.
