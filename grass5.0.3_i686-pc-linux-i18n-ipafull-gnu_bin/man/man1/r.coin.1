       _r_._c_o_i_n tabulates the mutual occurrence of two raster map layers'  cate-
       gories with respect to one another.  This analysis program respects the
       current geographic region and mask settings.


       The user can run the program non-interactively by specifying all needed
       flags settings and parameter values on the command line, in the form:


       rr..ccooiinn [--qqww] mmaapp11==_n_a_m_e mmaapp22==_n_a_m_e uunniittss==_n_a_m_e

       mmaapp22==_n_a_m_e

              Units of measure in which to output report results.
              Options: _c_, _p_, _x_, _y_, _a_, _h_, _k_, _m



       Alternately, the user can run _r_._c_o_i_n  interactively  by  simply  typing
       rr..ccooiinn  without  command line arguments; in this case, the user will be
       prompted for the names of the two raster map layers which will  be  the
       subjects  of the coincidence analysis.  _r_._c_o_i_n then tabulates the coin-
       cidence of category values among the two map layers  and  prepares  the
       basic table from which the report is to be created.  This tabulation is
       followed by an indication of how long the coincidence  table  will  be.
       If  the table is extremely long, the user may decide that viewing it is
       not so important after all, and may cancel the request at  this  point.
       Assuming  the user continues, _r_._c_o_i_n then allows the user to choose one
       of eight units of measure in which the report  results  can  be  given.
       These units are:



       _c cells

       _p percent cover of region

       _x percent of  category (column)

       _y percent of  category (row)

       _a acres

       _h hectares

       _k square kilometers

       _m square miles



       Note  that  three  of  these options give results as percentage values:
       "p" is based on the grand total number of cells; "x" is based  on  only
       column  totals;  and "y" is based on only row totals.  Only one unit of
       measure can be selected per report output.  Type in  just  one  of  the
       letters  designating a unit of measure followed by a for review.  After
       reviewing the report on the screen, the user is given several  options.
       The  report  may  be  saved  to  a  file  and/or sent to a printer.  If
       printed, it may be printed with either 80 or 132 columns.  Finally, the
       user  is  given  the option to rerun the coincidence tabulation using a
       different unit of measurement.


       Below is a sample of tabular output produced by _r_._c_o_i_n.  Here, map out-
       put is stated in units of square miles.  The report tabulates the coin-
       cidence of the Spearfish sample database's _o_w_n_e_r and  _r_o_a_d  raster  map
       layers' categories.  The _o_w_n_e_r categories in this case refer to whether
       the land is in private hands (category 1) or is owned by the U.S.  For-
       est Service (category 2). The _r_o_a_d_s map layer categories refer to vari-
       ous types of roads (with the exception of  category  value  "0",  which
       indicates  "no  data";  i.e.,  map  locations at which no roads exist).
       _r_._c_o_i_n does not report category labels. The user should run _r_._r_e_p_o_r_t or
       _r_._c_a_t_s to obtain this information.


       The  body  of  the report is arranged in panels. The map layer with the
       most categories is arranged along the vertical axis of the  table;  the
       other,  along the horizontal axis.  Each panel has a maximum of 5 cate-
       gories (9 if printed) across the top. In addition, the last two columns
       reflect  a  cross  total of each column for each row.  All of the cate-
       gories of the map layer arranged along the vertical axis  are  included
       in  each  panel.   There is a total at the bottom of each column repre-
       senting the sum of all the rows in that column. A second  total  repre-
       sents  the  sum of all the non-zero category rows. A cross total (Table
       Row Total) of all columns for each row appears in a separate panel.


       Note how the following information may  be  obtained  from  the  sample
       report.


       In  the  Spearfish  data base, in area not owned by the Forest Service,
       there are 50.63 square miles of land not used for roads. Roads make  up
       9.27 square miles of land in this area.


       Of  the  total  102.70 square miles in Spearfish, 42.80 square miles is
       owned by the Forest Service.
       In total, there are 14.58 square miles of roads.


       There are more category 2 roads outside Forest Service land  (2.92  mi.
       sq.)  than there are inside Forest land boundaries (0.72 mi. sq.).


       Following is a sample report.

NNOOTTEESS
       It  is  nnoott  a  good idea to run _r_._c_o_i_n on a map layer which has a mon-
       strous number of categories  (e.g.,  unreclassed  elevation).   Because
       _r_._c_o_i_n reports information for each and every category, it is better to
       reclassify those categories (using _r_e_c_l_a_s_s) into a more manageable num-
       ber prior to running _r_._c_o_i_n on the reclassed raster map layer.


       _r_._c_o_i_n  calculates  the coincidence of two raster map layers.  Although
       _r_._c_o_i_n allows the user to rerun the report using different units, it is
       not  possible to simply rerun the report with different map layers.  In
       order to choose new map layers, it is necessary to rerun _r_._c_o_i_n_.
