DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       _i_._m_a_x_l_i_k is a maximum-likelihood discriminant analysis classifier.   It
       can  be  used to perform the second step in either an unsupervised or a
       supervised image classification.


       Either image classification methods are performed in  two  steps.   The
       first  step  in  an  unsupervised  image classification is performed by
       _i_._c_l_u_s_t_e_r; the first step in a supervised classification is executed by
       the  GRASS program _i_._c_l_a_s_s. In both cases, the second step in the image
       classification procedure is performed by _i_._m_a_x_l_i_k.


       In an unsupervised classification,  the  maximum-likelihood  classifier
       uses  the cluster means and covariance matrices from the _i_._c_l_u_s_t_e_r sig-
       nature file to determine to which category (spectral class)  each  cell
       in  the image has the highest probability of belonging. In a supervised
       image classification, the maximum-likelihood classifier uses the region
       means  and  covariance matrices from the spectral signature file gener-
       ated by _i_._c_l_a_s_s, based on regions (groups of image  pixels)  chosen  by
       the user, to determine to which category each cell in the image has the
       highest probability of belonging.


       In either case, the raster map layer output by _i_._m_a_x_l_i_k is a classified
       image in which each cell has been assigned to a spectral class (i.e., a
       category).  The spectral classes (categories) can be  related  to  spe-
       cific land cover types on the ground.


       The  program will run non-interactively if the user specifies the names
       of raster map layers, i.e., group and subgroup  names,  seed  signature
       file name, result classification file name, and any combination of non-
       required options in the  command  line,  using  the  form  ii..mmaaxxlliikk[--qq]
       ggrroouupp==_n_a_m_e ssuubbggrroouupp==_n_a_m_e ssiiggffiillee==_n_a_m_e ccllaassss==_n_a_m_e [rreejjeecctt==_n_a_m_e]

       where each flag and options have the meanings stated below.


       Alternatively,  the  user  can simply type _i_._m_a_x_l_i_k in the command line
       without program arguments. In this case the user will be  prompted  for
       the program parameter settings; the program will run foreground.

              The imagery group contains the subgroup to be classified.

       ssuubbggrroouupp==_n_a_m_e
              The subgroup contains image files, which were used to create the
              signature file in the program _i_._c_l_u_s_t_e_r, _i_._c_l_a_s_s, or _i_._g_e_n_s_i_g to
              be classified.

       ssiiggffiillee==_n_a_m_e
              The name of the signatures to be used  for  the  classification.
              The  signature file contains the cluster and covariance matrices
              that were calculated by the  GRASS  program  _i_._c_l_u_s_t_e_r  (or  the
              region  means  and  covariance matrices generated by _i_._c_l_a_s_s, if
              the user runs a supervised classification). These spectral  sig-
              natures  are  what  determine  the categories (classes) to which
              image pixels will be assigned during the classification process.

       ccllaassss==_n_a_m_e
              The  name of a raster map holds the classification results. This
              new raster map layer will contain categories that can be related
              to land cover categories on the ground.

       rreejjeecctt==_n_a_m_e
              The  optional  name  of  a raster map holds the reject threshold
              results. This is the result of a chi square test  on  each  dis-
              criminant  result  at  various threshold levels of confidence to
              determine at what confidence level each cell classified (catego-
              rized).  It  is the reject threshold map layer, and contains one
              calculated confidence level for  each  classified  cell  in  the
              classified image. One of the possible uses for this map layer is
              as a mask, to identify cells in the classified image  that  have
              the lowest probability of being assigned to the correct class.


NNOOTTEESS
       The  maximum-likelihood classifier assumes that the spectral signatures
       for each class (category) in each band file  are  normally  distributed
       (i.e., Gaussian in nature).  Algorithms, such as _i_._c_l_u_s_t_e_r, _i_._c_l_a_s_s, or
       _i_._g_e_n_s_i_g, however, can create signatures that are not valid distributed
       (more  likely with _i_._c_l_a_s_s_)_.  If this occurs, _i_._m_a_x_l_i_k will reject them
       and display a warning message.


       This program runs interactively if the user types _i_._m_a_x_l_i_k only. If the
       user  types _i_._m_a_x_l_i_k along with all required options, it will overwrite
       the classified raster map without prompting if this map existed.
