       This program reads a previously selected subset  of  STF1  or  PL94-171
       U.S. Census Bureau demographic records (see _m_._i_n_._s_t_f_1_._t_a_p_e), and writes
       one of the following: GRASS site list (coordinates and a value).  GRASS
       vector  polygon  attribute labels file (coordinates and a label value).
       Text report to stdout in one of two formats.



       Any arithmetic expression combining constants with any of the more than
       900  hundred  demographic  (numeric)  fields can be defined and will be
       evaluated (by the Unix _b_c _-_l utility) to compute  the  value  for  each
       input record.


       The  location coordinates for the polygon label point or the site loca-
       tion is obtained from certain columns (269-287) in the  input  records,
       making  this program quite specific for the specified types of STF1 and
       PL94-171 input file records.  Use with other types of input data is not
       advised.

       The string after the '='  in  this  parameter  almost  always  must  be
       enclosed  in  quotes to protect it from Shell interpretation of charac-
       ters such as * / (  ) and spaces (which may be used to  increase  read-
       ability,  but  are  not  necessary).  This string is always of the form
       _m_a_p_n_a_m_e_=_e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n.


       The _m_a_p_n_a_m_e string can be any legal GRASS map name (up  to  14  charac-
       ters).  The second '=' is required and may be preceeded and followed by
       a space.


       In the _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n, great flexibility is provided for the computation of
       interesting   combinations   of   the  data  fields  contained  in  the
       demographic records.


       The usual operators used in the _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n include: +, -, *, /, and  %.
       The  user should review the Unix manual entry for the _b_c calculator for
       the complete list of available functions and other operators.


       Parentheses are used in the normal algebraic manner.


       The operands in the _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n may consist of any mixture of:


       integer constants real constants functions allowed by _b_c numeric fields
       from the demographic records


       Numeric  fields from both the IDENTIFICATION and MATRIX SECTIONS of the
       demographic records may be used.  Review the User and  Technical  Docu-
       mentation  for  these  demographic  files; or use the _-_p option of this
       program to print the MATRIX  SECTION  document  (the  demographic  data
       fields).   When  substituting  values  from the numeric fields into the
       expression,  characters are replaced by zero.  (Spaces, which are  rare
       in  the  demographic  data, are usually the result of missing values or
       restricted information).


       The numeric fields from the demographic records may  be  designated  in
       one of three ways in the _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n.



              length of the numeric field in the data records: A=1, B=2, ... ,
              I=9, J=10, O=15, etc; and 'cccc' is the starting  column  number
              for  the  data field of interest: 301 for 100% population count,
              7221 for total number of four-room housing units, 58  for  101st
              Congressional  District,  etc.   The proper specification of the
              Congressional District number would be 'B58'  because  it  is  a
              two-column field.  'I301' would indicate that the 100% poplation
              should be used in the calculation; it's a nine-column field.



               'Pnna0nnn' or 'Hnna0nnn', where 'n' is a digit  and  'a'  is  a
              digit  or (rarely) upper case letter.  These forms represent the
              MATRIX field naming schemes used in the CD-ROM "dBase 3"  files.
              They  can  be used in processing STF1 records extracted from the
              CD-ROM or TAPE distribution media.  All eight characters of  the
              field  name  must  be  used.  (Note: this form cannot be used in
              processing the PL94-171 records.)



              IDENTIFICATION SECTION field names (67 fields)  for  the  "loca-
              tional"  information  contained  in  the first 300 characters of
              each record.  The field name, in all upper case letters, may  be
              used  if the numeric value of the field is needed in the _e_x_p_r_e_s_-
              _s_i_o_n.  Two of the most useful fields are  AREALAND  and  AREAWAT
              which allow the direct computation of population density values.



       The _b_c calculator usually returns a value with a very large  number  of
       decimal  places.   Vector  attributes are automatically truncated(!) to
       integers by the v.support program when  the  topology  file  is  built.
       Site list descriptions are likewise truncated to integers by GRASS pro-
       grams which use the descriptions as numeric values (e.g., sites to cell
       in _s_._m_e_n_u ).

       The  default  operation of _v_._a_p_p_l_y_._c_e_n_s_u_s when tabular reports are pro-
       duced to _s_t_d_o_u_t (when not making a sites list or vector attribute file)
       is  to  print  the  easting and northing coordinates and then the value
       resulting from the _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n.  Often the user wishes to have an  iden-
       tifier  different  from  the  coordinates.   The  construction  _o_u_t_=_t_a_-
       _b_l_e_:_f_i_e_l_d will replace the coordinates with the character string  indi-
       cated  by _f_i_e_l_d, which may have any of the three forms used for numeric
       fields in the formula _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n, see  above.   Note:  a  special  case
       exists  for  the  66 character description field which begins in column
       192; the entire field will be printed if designated by either of  these
       two forms: _o_u_t_=_t_a_b_l_e_:_A_N_P_S_A_D_P_I or _o_u_t_=_t_a_b_l_e_:_Z_1_9_2.


       Complex  tables may be produced by making multiple runs of _v_._a_p_p_l_y_._c_e_n_-
       _s_u_s, redirecting the tabular output to files, and using the Unix  tools
       _c_u_t_, _p_a_s_t_e, and _c_o_l_r_m to combine the resulting files.

       Computational errors in _b_c are not handled too gracefully: a warning is
       output and a zero result is used.


       _b_c tends to output lots of decimal places.  The user must clean this up
       for output sent to stdout.


       The  GRASS  site  list  output  format used includes the '#' before the
       label value to facilitate the production of raster maps with cell  val-
       ues representing the results of the formula execution.


       If  using  the  "name_field"  and "ef" parameters, the formula file may
       contain only one formula.
