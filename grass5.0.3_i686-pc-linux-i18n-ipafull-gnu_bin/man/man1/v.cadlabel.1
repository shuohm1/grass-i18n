       _v_._c_a_d_l_a_b_e_l attaches labels to index contour lines by  using  the  index
       contour lines and lables files that have been converted from DXF format
       to GRASS vector format by the _v_._i_n_._d_x_f program.  Users have the  option
       of  creating either binary or ASCII output with _v_._i_n_._d_x_f.  Since _v_._c_a_d_-
       _l_a_b_e_l works only  on  binary  vector  files,  the  ASCII  GRASS  vector
       (dig_ascii)  files  that are generated by _v_._i_n_._d_x_f must be converted to
       binary GRASS vector (dig) files using  the  _v_._i_n_._a_s_c_i_i  program  before
       _v_._c_a_d_l_a_b_e_l can be executed.


       _v_._c_a_d_l_a_b_e_l searches a binary GRASS vector file of contour lines to find
       the contour lines that are closest to each box (contour label)  in  the
       binary  GRASS  vector  file containing contour labels.  The two contour
       lines that are closest to a box are tagged with the same label (an ele-
       vation value) as that of the box.

       Program parameters are described below.

       lliinneess==_n_a_m_e
              Name  of  the  binary GRASS vector (dig) file, imported from DXF
              format, that contains index contour lines.

       llaabbeellss==_n_a_m_e
              Name of the binary GRASS vector (dig_att)  file,  imported  from
              DXF format, that contains index contour line labels.


NNOOTTEESS
       Because  line  data  that  are created in CAD format may have unsnapped
       nodes or gaps, _v_._c_a_d_l_a_b_e_l will not always be able to label every  index
       contour  line.   Also, intermediate contour lines that may be contained
       in the index contour vector file (because they resided on the same  DXF
       level  as  the  index contour lines in the DXF design file) will not be
       labeled.  Any lines that are not labeled with _v_._c_a_d_l_a_b_e_l can be labeled
       with the contour labeling program in _v_._d_i_g_i_t.


       If  the  intermediate  contour  lines are in a separate GRASS dig file,
       they can be patched to an labeled index contour  file  with  the  GRASS
       program _v_._p_a_t_c_h, and then labeled in _v_._d_i_g_i_t.


       The user does not need to _v_._p_a_t_c_h the labels vector file (boxes) to the
       lines vector file (contour lines).  The purpose of  the  labels  vector
       file  is  to determine which labels should be assigned to which contour
       lines (in the lines vector file) during the execution of _v_._c_a_d_l_a_b_e_l.
