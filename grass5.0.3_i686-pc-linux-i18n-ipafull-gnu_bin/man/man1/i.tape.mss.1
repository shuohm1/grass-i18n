       _i_._t_a_p_e_._m_s_s is a  program  that  extracts  Multispectral  Scanner  (MSS)
       imagery data from tape.


       This  program must be run in a LOCATION_NAME with a x,y coordinate sys-
       tem (i.e., a coordinate system with projection 0).  For further  infor-
       mation  regarding  this  LOCATION_NAME  refer  to  the manual entry for
       _i_m_a_g_e_r_y.


       The first prompt in _i_._t_a_p_e_._m_s_s asks the user for the tape device  name.
       This  is sometimes  /dev/rmt0 (for a half-inch tape with a tape density
       of 1600), but this varies with each machine.


       The next prompt is:
       Please mount and load tape, then hit RETURN

       The first menu in the program asks the user for information  about  the
       data.



           please enter the following information

        Tape Identification:                             __

        Image Description:                               __

        Title for the Extracted Raster (Cell) Files:     __

        AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT <ESC> TO CONTINUE
                      (OR <Ctrl-C> TO CANCEL)


       This  program  automatically enters the scene ID number and the date of
       the image into the field for Tape Identification.  The sun  angles  are
       automatically entered into the field for Image Description.


       The second menu is:
                       MSS TAPE EXTRACTION
       please select the desired tape window (geographic
       region definition) to extract

                    first row: _______(1-2984)
                    last row: _______(1-2984)

                    first col: _______(1-3548)
                    last col: _______(1-3548)


       AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT <ESC> TO CONTINUE
                     (OR <Ctrl-C> TO CANCEL)


       The  numbers in parentheses are the total number of rows and columns on
       the tape including filler (zeros).   This  information  and  additional
       information   can  also  be  obtained  by  running  the  GRASS  program
       _i_._t_a_p_e_._m_s_s_._h which reads the header information on an  MSS  tape.   Any
       subset  of the image on tape may be extracted.  For a discussion of row
       and column extraction see the subheading TITLEd ROW AND COLUMN  EXTRAC-
       TION below.


       The next menu is:
       please make an x by the bands you want extracted

                             _____ 1
                             _____ 2
                             _____ 3
                             _____ 4

       AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT <ESC> TO CONTINUE
                     (OR <Ctrl-C> TO CANCEL)

       MSS imagery has 4 bands, but the user may want to extract only a subset
       of these bands.  See the subheading in this entry TITLEd ROW AND COLUMN
       EXTRACTION.


       The  user then is asked to enter the prefix/group for the band files to
       be created.  This name will  precede  each  band  file  extracted  into
       GRASS.   For  example, if three bands are extracted the following three
       (raster) band files will result:


       _p_r_e_f_i_x_n_a_m_e_._1
       _p_r_e_f_i_x_n_a_m_e_._2
       _p_r_e_f_i_x_n_a_m_e_._3


       Whatever _p_r_e_f_i_x_n_a_m_e is specified will  also  automatically  become  the
       name  for the imagery group file being created.  Each image (i.e., each
       run of _i_._t_a_p_e_._m_s_s) should be given a unique prefix/group name.


       The extraction process will begin by first skipping the number of spec-
       ified  files, advancing to the starting row, and then reading the tape.
       The percent completion of the extraction is displayed on the screen. If
       more  than  one  tape  is required to store the image, the program will
       pause and inform the user to mount the next tape.


       The extracted (raster) band files will be listed as raster  map  layers
       available  in  the  current MAPSET and may be displayed using the GRASS
       commands _d_._d_i_s_p_l_a_y, _d_._r_a_s_t or _i_._p_o_i_n_t_s.

NNOOTTEESS
       After extracting an image from tape, the geographic  region  definition
       in  the  x,y  coordinate  LOCATION_NAME  will  be  set  based  upon the
       extracted rows and columns from the tape.  The relationship between the
       image  rows and columns and the geographic coordinates of the region is
       discussed in the manual entry for _i_m_a_g_e_r_y.


       This program is interactive and requires no command line arguments.

       The display options in GRASS allow the user to locate rows and  columns
       on  the  digital image.  If enough disk space is available, one band of
       an entire image, or one band of a portion of an image known to  contain
       the area of interest, can be extracted and displayed.  The _m_e_a_s_u_r_e_m_e_n_t_s
       option in _d_._d_i_s_p_l_a_y, or _d_._w_h_e_r_e (following the use of _d_._r_a_s_t) will echo
       x  and  y  coordinates  to the screen.  (These coordinates will display
       negative numbers in the north-south direction, but ignoring  the  nega-
       tive sign will yield the row number.)  See the _i_m_a_g_e_r_y manual entry for
       further explanation.


       If a photograph of the digital image is available, the rows and columns
       to  be  extracted  can be determined from it by associating inches with
       the total number of known rows and columns in the scene.  For  example,
       if the total length of the photograph is 12 inches, the total number of
       rows on the tape is 2000, and the  northwest  corner  of  the  area  of
       interest begins 2 inches from the top of the photo, then:
            12" / 2000 rows = 2" / x rows
            x = 333.333

       The  northwest  corner  of the area of interest starts at row 333.  The
       starting row, ending row, starting column, and  ending  column  can  be
       calculated in this manner.
