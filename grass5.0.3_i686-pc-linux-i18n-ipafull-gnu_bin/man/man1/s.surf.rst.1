       _s_._s_u_r_f_._r_s_t

       This  program  interpolates the zi-values from point data (e.g., eleva-
       tions, climatic stations, drill holes, etc.)  given  in  a  sites  file
       named  _i_n_p_u_t  as  x|y|%z1  %z2  ...%zi...   to grid cells in the output
       raster file _e_l_e_v representing a surface.  The  user  can  select  which
       floating  point attribute will be interpolated by setting the parameter
       _f_i_e_l_d to the value i for the i-th floating point attribute..

       As an option, simultaneously with interpolation, topographic parameters
       slope, aspect, profile curvature (measured in the direction of steepest
       slope), tangential curvature (measured in the direction of a tangent to
       contour  line) or mean curvature are computed and saved as raster files
       specified by the options _s_l_o_p_e_, _a_s_p_e_c_t_,  _p_c_u_r_v_,  _t_c_u_r_v_,  _m_c_u_r_v  respec-
       tively.   If _-_d flag is set the program outputs partial derivatives fx,
       fy, fxx, fyy, fxy instead of slope,  aspect,  profile,  tangential  and
       mean curvatures respectively.

       User  can  define  a raster file named _m_a_s_k_m_a_p, which will be used as a
       mask. The interpolation is skipped for cells which have  zero  or  NULL
       value  in  mask.  Data  points are checked for identical points and the
       points that are closer to each other than the given _d_m_i_n  are  removed.
       Parameter  _z_m_u_l_t  allows user to rescale the z-values for sites (useful
       e.g. for transformation of elevations given in feet to meters, so  that
       the proper values of slopes and curvatures can be computed).

       Regularized  spline  with tension and smoothing is used for  interpola-
       tion and approximation. The _t_e_n_s_i_o_n parameter tunes  the  character  of
       the  resulting  surface  from  thin plate to membrane. The experimental
       flag _-_t can be set to use "dnorm independent tension", (see  notes  for
       more  details about the tension behavior). For noisy data, it is possi-
       ble to define either a constant smoothing parameter _s_m_o_o_t_h or  a  vari-
       able smoothing parameter by  setting the parameter _s_m_a_t_t to the value j
       for the j-th floating point attribute in the _i_n_p_u_t  site  file,  repre-
       senting the smoothing parameter for each point. When smoothing is used,
       it is possible to output site file _d_e_v_i containing  deviations  of  the
       resulting surface from the given data.

       If  the  number  of given points is greater than _s_e_g_m_a_x, segmented pro-
       cessing is used. The region is split into  rectangular  segments,  each
       having  less  than _s_e_g_m_a_x points and interpolation is performed on each
       segment of the region. To ensure  smooth  connection  of  segments  the
       interpolation function for each segment is computed using the points in
       given segment and the points in its neighborhood which are in the rect-
       angular  window  surrounding  the  given  segment. The number of points
       taken for interpolation is controlled by _n_p_m_i_n, the value of which must
       be larger than _s_e_g_m_a_x.  User can choose to output vector files _t_r_e_e_f_i_l_e
       and _o_v_e_r_f_i_l_e which represent the quad tree used  for  segmentation  and
       overlapping  neighborhoods  from which additional points for interpola-
       tion on each segment were taken. Anisotropic surfaces can  be  interpo-
       lated  setting  anisotropy  angle  _t_h_e_t_a and scaling factor _s_c_a_l_e_x. The
       program writes several important values to history file of  raster  map
       _e_l_e_v.   If  the  input  data  have time stamp, the program creates time
       stamp for all output files.

       The user must run _g_._r_e_g_i_o_n before the program to  set  the  region  and
       resolution for interpolation.

       The  user  can  run  this  program either interactively or non-interac-
       tively.  The program will be run non-interactively if the  user  speci-
       fies  program arguments and flag settings on the command line using the
       form:

       Alternately, the user can simply type ss..ssuurrff..rrsstt on  the  command  line
       without  program arguments. In this case, the user will be prompted for
       parameter values and flag settings  using  the  standard  GRASS  parser
       interface described in the manual entry for _p_a_r_s_e_r.

NNOOTTEESS
       _s_._s_u_r_f_._r_s_tuses regularized spline with  tensionfor  interpolation  from
       point data. Point data should be in a new site format , that means for-
       mat x|y|%z1 %z2 ...%zi..., instead of the  old  format  which  confused
       categories  with values (x|y|#z).  If program detects the old format it
       will allow users to have the site file rewritten to a new format  auto-
       matically.

       The  implementation  has  a  segmentation  procedure based on quadtrees
       which enhances the efficiency for large data sets. The GRASS5.0 version
       has  enhanced  segmentation  which takes more points for the large seg-
       ments, to reduce the potential for visibility of  segmentens  in  areas
       with sparse data.

       Special  color  tables  are  created  by  the program for output raster
       files.

       Topographic parameters are computed  directly  from  the  interpolation
       function  so  that the important relationships between these parameters
       are preserved. The equations for computation of  these  parameters  and
       their  interpretation  are  described in (Mitasova and Hofierka 1993 ).
       Slopes and aspect are computed  in  degrees  (0-90  and  1-360  respec-
       tively).  The  aspect  raster  file  has value 0 assigned to flat areas
       (with slope less than 0.1%)  and  to  singular  points  with  undefined
       aspect.  Aspect  points  downslope  and  is 90 to the North, 180 to the
       West, 270 to the South and 360 to the East, the values  increase  coun-
       terclockwise.  Curvatures are positive for convex and negative for con-
       cave areas. Singular points with  undefined  curvatures  have  assigned
       zero values.

       _T_e_n_s_i_o_n  and  _s_m_o_o_t_hing  allow user to tune the surface character.  For
       most landscape scale applications the default should work fine.The pro-
       gram  gives warning when significant overshoots appear in the resulting
       surface and higher tension or smoothing should be used.


       While it is possible to automatize the selection  of  suitable  _t_e_n_s_i_o_n
       and  _s_m_o_o_t_hing,  it has not been done yet, so here are some hints which
       may help to choose the proper parameters if the results  look  "weird".
       It is useful to know that the method is scale dependent and the _t_e_n_s_i_o_n
       works as a rescaling parameter (high _t_e_n_s_i_o_n "increases  the  distances
       between  the points" and reduces the range of impact of each point, low
       _t_e_n_s_i_o_n "decreases the distance" and the points  influence  each  other
       over  longer  range). Surface with  _t_e_n_s_i_o_n set too high behaves like a
       membrane (rubber sheet stretched over the data points) with peak or pit
       ("crater")  in  each  given  point and everywhere else the surface goes
       rapidly to trend. If digitized contours are used as  input  data,  high
       tension  can  cause  artificial waves along contours. Lower tension and
       higher smoothing is suggested for such a case.


       Surface with _t_e_n_s_i_o_n set too low behaves like a stiff steel  plate  and
       overshoots  can  appear in areas with rapid change of gradient and seg-
       mentation can be visible. Increase tension should solve the problems.

       There are two options how _t_e_n_s_i_o_n can be applied in relation  to  _d_n_o_r_m
       (dnorm  rescales  the coordinates depending on the average data density
       so that the size of segments with _s_e_g_m_a_x_=40 points is around 1  -  this
       ensures the numerical stability of the computation):

       1.  Default  (used also in s.surf.tps): the given _t_e_n_s_i_o_n is applied to
       normalized data (x/_d_n_o_r_m..),  that means that the distances are  multi-
       plied  (rescaled)  by  _t_e_n_s_i_o_n_/_d_n_o_r_m.  If density of points is changed,
       e.g.,  by using higher _d_m_i_n, the _d_n_o_r_m changes and _t_e_n_s_i_o_n needs to  be
       changed  too to get the same result.  Because the _t_e_n_s_i_o_n is applied to
       normalized data its suitable value is usually within the  10-100  range
       and  does  not  depend  on the actual scale (distances) of the original
       data (which can be km for regional applications or cm for field experi-
       ments).


       2.  Flag --tt (experimental for s.surf.rst):: The given _t_e_n_s_i_o_n is applied
       to un-normalized data (rescaled tension = t_e_n_s_i_o_n_*_d_n_o_r_m/1000 is applied
       to  normalized data (x/_d_n_o_r_m) and therefore  _d_n_o_r_m cancels out) so here
       _t_e_n_s_i_o_n truly works as a rescaling parameter.   For  regional  applica-
       tions  with  distances between points in km the suitable tension can be
       0.1 or smaller, for detailed field scale analysis with distances in  cm
       it  can  be  500  or  more. To help select how much the data need to be
       rescaled  the  program   writes   _d_n_o_r_m   and   rescaled   tension=_t_e_n_-
       _s_i_o_n_*_d_n_o_r_m/1000 at the beginning of the program run. This rescaled _t_e_n_-
       _s_i_o_n should be around 20-30.  If it is lower or higher, the given  _t_e_n_-
       _s_i_o_n parameter should be changed accordingly.

       The default is a recommended choice, however for the applications where
       the user needs to change density of data and preserve the interpolation
       character the --tt flag can be helpful.

       Anisotropic  data  (e.g.  geologic phenomena) can be interpolated using
       _t_h_e_t_a and _s_c_a_l_e_x defining orientation and ratio  of  the  perpendicular
       axes  put  on  the  longest/shortest side of the feature, respectively.
       _T_h_e_t_a is measured in degrees from East, counterclockwise. _S_c_a_l_e_x  is  a
       ratio  of  axes  sizes.   Setting _s_c_a_l_e_x in the range 0-1, you will get
       pattern prolonged in the direction defined by _t_h_e_t_a. _S_c_a_l_e_x  value  0.5
       means  that your feature is approximatelly 2 times longer in the direc-
       tion of _t_h_e_t_a than in the  perpendicular  direction.   _S_c_a_l_e_x  value  2
       means that axes ratio is reverse and you will get pattern perpendicular
       to the previous example. Please note that  anisotropy  option  has  not
       been  extensively  tested and may include bugs - if there are problems,
       please    report    to    GRASS     bugtracker     (accessible     from
       http://grass.itc.it/).


       For  data  with  values changing over several magnitudes (sometimes the
       concentration or density data) it is suggested to interpolate  the  log
       of the values rather than the original ones.

       The  program checks the numerical stability of the algorithm by comput-
       ing the values in given points. The root mean  square  deviation  (rms)
       between  interpolated and given values is written into the history file
       of raster map _e_l_e_v. For computation with smoothing set to  0.  the  rms
       should be 0. Significant increase in tension is suggested if the rms is
       unexpectedly high for this case. With smoothing parameter greater  than
       zero  the surface will not pass exactly through the data points and the
       higher the parameter the closer the surface will be to the  trend.  The
       rms  then  represents  a  measure  of  smoothing  effect  on data. More
       detailed analysis of smoothing effects can be performed using the  out-
       put deviations option and running s.univar on the site file with devia-
       tions.

       The program writes the values of parameters used  in  computation  into
       the  comment  part of history file _e_l_e_v as well as the following values
       which help to evaluate the results and choose the suitable  parameters:
       minimum  and  maximum  z values in the data file (zmin_data, zmax_data)
       and in the interpolated  raster  map  (zmin_int,  zmax_int),  rescaling
       parameter used for normalization (dnorm), which influences the tension.

       When the number of points in a site file is not too  large  (less  than
       800), the user can skip segmentation by setting _s_e_g_m_a_x to the number of
       data points or segmax=700.

       The program gives warning when user wants to  interpolate  outside  the
       rectangle  given  by minimum and maximum coordinates in site file, zoom
       into the area where the points are is suggested in this case.

       When a mask is used, the program takes all points in the  given  region
       for  interpolation, including those in the area which is masked out, to
       ensure proper interpolation along the border of the mask. It  therefore
       does  not  mask  out  the data points, if this is desirable, it must be
       done outside s.surf.rst (e.g. using r.mask.points).
