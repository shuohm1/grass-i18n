       This report describes the use and operation  of  the  program  _v_._p_l_a_n_t,
       used  with  the GRASS GIS system.  The report contains (i) a discussion
       of the problem which motivated the development of the program,  (ii)  a
       description  of  the  method used, (iii) the manual page describing the
       usage of the program,  (iv) a listing of the source-code.

       Projections are representations of information defined on  curved  sur-
       faces  (usually  spheroids)  in two-dimensional space.  This allows the
       description of the location information in  cartesian  or  other  plane
       coordinate  systems.   Particular  projections  are  defined by precise
       mathematical relations, which allows conversion of  maps  from  between
       projections  to  be  achieved using straightforward mathematical opera-
       tions [1].

       When converted from  one  map  projection  to  another,  straight-lines
       become  curves.   Thus,  a  line segment which can be described by four
       parameters only (eg the coordinates of the end points) in  one  projec-
       tion  becomes  an arc which needs more parameters in other projections.
       In GIS systems which describe arcs as a sequence of line segments, this
       means  that  intermediate  points  between  the ends of the segment are
       used.  The easiest method of projecting a line accurately is to include
       intermediate  points  in  the  description in the source projection, so
       that all these points are included in the target map.

       Vector maps (lines and arcs) in the GRASS GIS are represented by a rel-
       atively  straightforward format.  This is exemplified in the ascii ver-
       sion of vector files, as produced by _v_._o_u_t_._a_s_c_i_i [2] and  described  in
       the  programmer's manual [3].  Individual vector segments are described
       by a sequence of coordinate pairs, with the number of coordinated pairs
       for  the segment recorded in a brief header for each segment.  The pro-
       gram _v_._p_r_u_n_e [4] is provided to  remove  points  which  are  considered
       redundant  through  being too close together within a segment.  _v_._p_l_a_n_t
       has been designed as the complement of this, to insert extra points  at
       a specified spacing along straight-line segments.

       _v_._p_l_a_n_t  has been implemented as a Bourne shell script.  The basic pro-
       cedure is as follows:

       1.  Write out the existing map in the _d_i_g___a_s_c_i_i format;

       2.  Use an included _a_w_k script to process each vector segment in  turn,
       moving  from  point  to point along the segment.  If a span between two
       adjacent points is greater than the specified threshold (in map  units)
       extra points are inserted collinearly.

       3.   The modified _d_i_g___a_s_c_i_i file is re-imported, overwriting the origi-
       nal file.

       Because the original _d_i_g file is overwritten, all the support files are
       preserved.   Since the vector segments remain in the same sequence, and
       all the original points remain in the modified map, including the  end-
       points of each segment, all topology, attributes, etc are maintained.

       The  usage is exemplified in the attached manual page.  The source code
       is also attached, which may be examined for a detailed understanding of
       the method.
