       The  GRASS  program _d_._m_o_n allows the user to start, select, list, query
       the status of, release control of, stop, and unlock control of,  avail-
       able  graphics monitors.  The user can run this program either interac-
       tively (through a series of menus), or non-interactively by typing  the
       name  of the monitor to start, stop, select, or unlock, and any desired
       flags on the command line.

       When the user enters the command  dd..mmoonn  without  specifying  parameter
       values, the below menu appears on the screen:
                               MONITOR MENU
       Making sure that the graphics monitor is running:

         1      - Start a graphics monitor
                (also automatically selects this monitor)
         2      - Stop a graphics monitor

       Choosing a graphics monitor for your graphics:

         3      - Select a graphics device for output
                (currently selected monitor:  name)
         4      - Release control of the graphics driver
                (let someone else use it)
                (option 4 appears only after selection of a monitor)

       RETURN   quit

       These parameters perform the following functions:

              In  order  to  display  on-screen  GRASS graphics, the user must
              _s_t_a_r_t and _s_e_l_e_c_t a graphics monitor.  By default, the _s_t_a_r_t com-
              mand  actually runs two commands, to both start and select what-
              ever monitor is named by the user. (The user can get a  list  of
              available  monitors  by setting the -l or -L flag on the command
              line.)


       When a  monitor  is  _s_t_a_r_t_e_d,  it  is  therefore  also  (automatically)
       _s_e_l_e_c_t_e_d  for  output,  unless the _-_s flag is set by the user; the user
       can also explictly _s_e_l_e_c_t a monitor that  has  been  started  (see  (3)
       below).   After  a  monitor  is  started, a blank graphics frame should
       appear on whatever terminal the user is using to display graphics.


       The desired monitor should be started once and need  not  be  restarted
       unless it is stopped (option _2) for some reason. A monitor may continue
       to run for any length of time, even when no GRASS session is being run.
       The monitor program runs in the background.

              SSttoopp aa MMoonniittoorr..
              Sometimes  the monitor program needs to be stopped (terminated).
              Choosing option 2 will terminate a user-specified  monitor  pro-
              gram.   A  graphics  monitor  has two different types of status:
              monitor program _n_o_t _r_u_n_n_i_n_g, and  monitor  _r_u_n_n_i_n_g.   A  monitor
              that has been started and/or selected will be listed as running;
              a monitor that has been stopped (or not started) will be  listed
              as  not running.  The -L (list status) flag will list the status
              of each monitor connected to the system.

              SSeelleecctt aa MMoonniittoorr..
              When the user _s_t_a_r_t_s  a  monitor,  it  is  also  (automatically)
              _s_e_l_e_c_t_e_d  for  graphics output unless the user sets the _-_s flag.
              In order to use (direct graphics output to) a monitor, the  user
              must  _s_e_l_e_c_t that monitor for use, either by simply starting the
              monitor without the -s flag or by explictly selecting the  moni-
              tor  for  output  using  option  3. Only running monitors can be
              selected for graphics output.  Once the user has _s_e_l_e_c_t_e_d a mon-
              itor for output, no other user can use this monitor for graphics
              output until the monitor driver is either _r_e_l_e_a_s_e_d (by the user)
              or _u_n_l_o_c_k_e_d (by any user on the system).


       The  user can run multiple graphics monitors by simply starting each of
       the graphics monitors drivers he wishes to direct output to.

               Once a user has _s_e_l_e_c_t_e_d a monitor for graphics output,  it  is
              locked for use by that user until either: (1) the user voluntar-
              ily releases control of the monitor for use by  another  (option
              4),  or (2) another GRASS user _u_n_l_o_c_k_s the user's control of the
              monitor.  Menu option 4 appears  only  to  the  person  who  has
              selected  the  monitor (since only that user can release control
              of his selected graphics monitor.) If  another  user  wishes  to
              _u_n_l_o_c_k  the  user's  control  of the monitor, that user must run
              _d_._m_o_n from the command line and set the uunnlloocckk==_n_a_m_e parameter.

       You may choose multiple options within the  _d_._m_o_n  program.   To  leave
       (exit) the _d_._m_o_n menu, press the  key.

NNOOTTEESS
       The  _d_._m_o_n  program  can  regulate control of graphics monitors both in
       systems using multiple monitors and in systems using a single  graphics
       monitor.
