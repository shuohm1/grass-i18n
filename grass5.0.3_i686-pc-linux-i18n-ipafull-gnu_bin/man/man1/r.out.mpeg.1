       _r_._o_u_t_._m_p_e_g  is a tool for combining a series of GRASS raster files into
       a single MPEG-1 (Motion Pictures Expert Group) format file.  MPEG-1  is
       a  "lossy"  video  compression format, so the quality of each resulting
       frame of the animation will be much diminished from the original raster
       image.   The  resulting  output  file  may  then  be  viewed using your
       favorite mpeg-format viewing program.


       The user may define up to four  "views",  or  sub-windows,  to  animate
       simultaneously.   e.g., View 1 could be rainfall, View 2 flooded areas,
       View 3 damage to bridges or levees, View 4 other economic  damage,  all
       animated as a time series. A black border 2 pixels wide is drawn around
       each view. There is an arbitrary limit of 100 files per view (100  ani-
       mation frames).  Temporary files are created in the conversion process,
       so lack of adequate tmp space could also limit the number of frames you
       are able to convert.


       The  environment  variable  GMPEG_SIZE is checked for a value to use as
       the dimension, in pixels, of the longest  dimension  of  the  animation
       image.   If  GMPEG_SIZE  is not set, the animation size defaults to the
       rows & columns in the current GRASS region, scaling if necessary  to  a
       default  minimum  size  of 200 and maximum of 500.  These size defaults
       are overridden when using the -c flag (see below).  The  resolution  of
       the  current  GRASS  region  is  maintained, independent of image size.
       Playback programs have to  decode  the  compressed  data  "on-the-fly",
       therefore  smaller  dimensioned  animations  will  provide higher frame
       rates and smoother animations.


       UNIX - style wild cards may be used with the command  line  version  in
       place of a raster file name, but it must be quoted.


       Example: _r_._o_u_t_._m_p_e_g _v_i_e_w_1_=_"_r_a_i_n_[_1_-_9_]_"_,_"_r_a_i_n_1_[_0_-_2_]_" _v_i_e_w_2_=_"_t_e_m_p_*_"


       If  the number of files differs for each view, the view with the fewest
       files will determine the number of frames in the animation.

       --qq     Quiet - suppress progress report.

       --cc     Convert "on the fly", uses less disk space  by  using  _r_._o_u_t_._p_p_m
              with  stdout  option  to  convert  frames  as  needed instead of
              converting all frames to ppm before  encoding.   Only  use  when
              encoding  a  single view.  Use of this option also overrides any
              size defaults, using the CURRENTLY DEFINED GRASS REGION for  the
              output  size.  So  be careful to set region to a reasonable size
              prior to encoding.

       oouuttppuutt Name for MPEG output file.  Default: gmovie.mpg

       qquuaall   Quality factor (1-5).  Default: 3

       A quality value of _q_u_a_l_=_1 will yield higher quality  images,  but  with
       less compression (larger MPEG file size).  Compression ratios will vary
       depending on the number of frames in the animation, but  an  MPEG  pro-
       duced  using _q_u_a_l_=_5 will usually be about 60% the size of the MPEG pro-
       duced using _q_u_a_l_=_1.

BBUUGGSS
       MPEG images must be 16-pixel aligned for successful compression, so  if
       the  rows  & columns of the calculated image size (scaled, with borders
       added) are not evenly divisible by 16, a few rows/columns will  be  cut
       off the bottom & right sides of the image. The MPEG format is optimized
       to recognize image MOTION, so abrupt changes from one frame to  another
       will cause a "noisy" encoding.

       This program requires the program _m_p_e_g___e_n_c_o_d_e:

       Use of the _-_c flag also requires the program _r_._o_u_t_._p_p_m with the  _s_t_d_o_u_t
       option.
