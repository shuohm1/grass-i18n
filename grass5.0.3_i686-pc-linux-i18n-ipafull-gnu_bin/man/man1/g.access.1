       This  program  allows the user to control access to the current mapset.
       Normally, any user can read data from any GRASS mapset.  But  sometimes
       it  is  desirable  to  prohibit  access  to certain sensitive data. The
       _g_._a_c_c_e_s_s command allows a user to restrict read and execute  access  to
       the  current mapset (see UNIX _c_h_m_o_d command).  _g_._a_c_c_e_s_s will not modify
       write access to the current mapset.


       The user may, for example, allow only users in the same UNIX  group  to
       read  data  files in the mapset, or restrict the mapset to personal use
       only.


       After typing gg..aacccceessss

       the user will be presented with a screen page which reflects  the  cur-
       rent  mapset  permissions.  The  user can then change them.  The screen
       page looks like:
        __________________________________________________________
       | LOCATION: spearfish                          MAPSET: demo|
       |                                                          |
       | This program allows you to control access to your        |
       | mapset by other users.                                   |
       |                                                          |
       | Access may be granted/removed for everyone, or for       |
       | everyone in your group.                                  |
       |                                                          |
       | Mark an 'x' to allow access;  erase the field to         |
       | restrict access.                                         |
       |                                                          |
       |     GROUP: _x_                                           |
       |     OTHER: _x_                                           |
       |                                                          |
       |    AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT <ESC> TO CONTINUE       |
       |                    (OR   <Ctrl-C>   TO   CANCEL)
       |
       |__________________________________________________________|


       If  you  remove  the  x (using the space bar), access will be denied to
       that class of user (group or other).  If you type an x, access will  be
       granted to that class of user.

       There is no non-interactive version of _g_._a_c_c_e_s_s.


       Under GRASS version 4.0, access to the mapset PERMANENT must be open to
       all users.  This is because GRASS looks for  the  user's  default  geo-
       graphic region definition settings and the location TITLE in files that
       are stored under the PERMANENT mapset directory.  The _g_._a_c_c_e_s_s command,
       therefore,  will  not  allow  you  to  restrict access to the PERMANENT
       mapset.


       The _g_._m_a_p_s_e_t_s command isn't smart enough to tell if access to a  speci-
       fied mapset is restricted, and the user is therefore allowed to include
       the names of restricted mapsets in his search path.  However, the  data
       in  a restricted mapset is still protected; any attempts to look for or
       use data in a restricted mapset will fail.  The user  will  simply  not
       see any data listed for a restricted mapset.
