       The CELL driver can be used to redirect the output of the GRASS monitor
       into a raster map. Features are:

                      storing graphical output into a file with better resolu-
                     tion than through screen grabbing.

                     saving  3-dimensional  output  from d.3d or other display
                     programs to a _D___c_e_l_l raster map.

                     saving display overlays (raster/raster/vector/...)  to  a
                     file  for high resolution export with r.out.tiff or simi-
                     lar
       The user will find a _D___c_e_l_l raster file in GRASS database  after start-
       ing  the  driver and using d.rast, d.vect etc. and finally stopping the
       driver again. The _D___c_e_l_l raster file is written during  closing  proce-
       dure (this may require some time according to the selected resolution).

       Then the user can export this file through r.out.tiff etc. for  use  in
       external mapping software.


       Be  aware that _D___c_e_l_l map is in a xy-projection which may differ to the
       current location's projection.  So the _D___c_e_l_l map  cannot  be  directly
       displayed on a GRASS monitor.

                     Set the map size for the CELL driver:
                     export   GRASS_WIDTH=xxx      (default   is  640)  export
                     GRASS_HEIGHT=yyy    (default is 480)

                     If "export" command is not accepted by  your  shell,  use
                     "setenv"   instead:   setenv   GRASS_WIDTH   xxx   setenv
                     GRASS_HEIGHT yyy

                     Start  the  CELL  driver:  d.mon  start=CELL    Wait  for
                     "Ready"  message (may take some time due to the file size
                     selected) d.mon select=CELL

                     Now the user can work with the  common  display  modules:
                     d.zzzz  (d.rast, d.vect, d.3d,...)   Note that an eventu-
                     ally started GRASS monitor won't display anything as  the
                     output is redirected to _D___c_e_l_l file.

                     Stop  the  CELL  driver  (and  write  _D___c_e_l_l file): d.mon
                     stop=CELL   Note that this may require some time.

                     To export the_D___c_e_l_l file,  re-set  the  region:  g.region
                     raster=D_cell Use the r.out.* export module.

       Note  that  the  _D___c_e_l_l  raster map is in xy-projection with simple xy-
       coordinates.


       The resolution of the _D___c_e_l_l raster map is defined by the map  extents.
       Use  _g_._r_e_g_i_o_n  _-_p  to  get  the  number  of  rows  and cols and use the
       environment variables to set the D_cell size.


       Note that the CELL driver is limited to 8bit colors.
