       _b_u_g_._r_e_p_o_r_t_._s_h is a Bourne shell (sh(1))  script  which,  when  given  a
       GRASS  5 module name, allows the user to complete a bug report for that
       program.  Completed bug reports can be e-mailed to the  GRASS  develop-
       ment Team (GRASS Bug report system), saved to a file in the user's home
       directory, or discarded.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       This program is not interactive;  the user must specify the name  of  a
       5.x  module  on  the command line.  Program arguments can optionally be
       entered by the user.

       _m_o_d_u_l_e___n_a_m_e
              The name of an existing GRASS version 5 program  tested  by  the
              user.

       _m_o_d_u_l_e___a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_(_s_)
              Program  arguments (parameters and/or flags) for the _m_o_d_u_l_e___n_a_m_e
              tested by the user.  The  user  should  enter  whatever  command
              arguments were actually run when the program bug occurred.


EEXXAAMMPPLLEE
       For  example,  if the user wished to complete a bug report on _v_._t_o_._r_a_s_t
       after running the program, the  user  might  then  type:  bbuugg..rreeppoorrtt..sshh
       v.to.rast

       A  standard  bug report form would then be displayed on the user's text
       terminal, containing the user's current GRASS region settings, and  the
       machine  name, GRASS data base, location, and mapset, on which the user
       is currently running GRASS.  Program parameters and flag settings,  and
       the command entered by the user on the command line, are also automati-
       cally entered on the bug report form.  The user is put into a text edi-
       tor  and expected to enter additional information describing the nature
       of the bug found or the results of program testing.


       The user is then asked whether the completed bug report is to be:  1  -
       mailed to grass-bugs@intevation.de
       2 - added to the file grass.bugs in the user's home directory
       3 - both 1 and 2
       4 - thrown away


NNOOTTEESS
       This  program  prints  whatever region settings, GRASS data base, loca-
       tion, and mapset are current when the  user  runs  _b_u_g_._r_e_p_o_r_t_._s_h.   The
       user  is therefore advised to run _b_u_g_._r_e_p_o_r_t_._s_h immediately after expe-
       riencing a program bug, to ensure that the settings  current  when  the
       bug occurred are reported on the bug report form.


       Note,  that  the  $EDITOR  environment  variable  is used to define the
       editor. The "vi" editor is the default editor.

FFIILLEESS
       This shell script is stored under the $GISBASE/scripts directory on the
       user's system.  The user is encouraged to examine the shell script com-
       mands stored in this directory and to produce similar scripts for their
       own use.
