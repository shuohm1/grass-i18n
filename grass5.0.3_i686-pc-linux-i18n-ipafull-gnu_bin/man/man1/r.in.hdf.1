       _r_._i_n_._h_d_f  allows  a user to create a GRASS raster map layer from a file
       in NCSA Hierarchical Data Format (HDF).

       ddsseettss  A list of reference numbers for datasets to be extracted.

       The  raster file created will have its southwest origin at 0 East and 0
       North, with resolution of 1.  To view the new GRASS  raster  file,  use
       _g_._r_e_g_i_o_n _r_a_s_t_=_n_e_w_f_i_l_e, then use _d_._r_a_s_t as normal.  You may wish to man-
       ually change the new raster's cellhd file.


       NCSA HDF is a multi-object file format developed by The National Center
       for Supercomputing Applications at Champaign, Illinois for the transfer
       of graphical and floating-point data between machines.  NASA Pathfinder
       AVHRR  data  is  stored  in  HDF format.  The HDF format defines both a
       raster type and a SDS (scientific data set) type.  The later  is  basi-
       cally  a highly structured multi-dimensional array of values.  A single
       HDF file may contain more than one SDS or raster; using the  _-_a  option
       will extract all data sets from the HDF file, creating a separate GRASS
       raster file from each data set and  naming  the  raster  files  output-
       name01,  outputname02,  outputname03.... If the _-_a option is not speci-
       fied and the HDF file contains more than one data set, only  the  first
       data set is extracted unless the user specifies specific reference num-
       bers for desired data sets in the file using the dsets option.  To  see
       a  list  of  reference numbers for data sets in an HDF file, use the _-_l
       flag.  If the HDF file contains labels or  descriptions  of  the  data,
       these  will  be  shown  when using the _-_l flag. Labels and descriptions
       from the HDF file will also be written to the GRASS history  file  when
       creating  the  raster  map.   If  a  multiplier is given using the mult
       option, every file created will be the product of the  input  data  set
       and  the  multiplier.  If the HDF file contains an SDS, it must be only
       two dimensional in order for _r_._i_n_._h_d_f to accept it as  input.   If  the
       HDF  file  contains an 8-bit raster image with an associated palette, a
       GRASS color file will be created.  This program will not import  24-bit
       HDF raster images.


       NCSA  distributes  the HDF library and several public domain visualiza-
       tion applications which use the HDF format.  Some  commercial  applica-
       tions  also  support HDF.  For more information, use the NCSA anonymous

       If a data set contains long labels and descriptions, some of it may  be
       truncated  when  writing  to  the GRASS history file. The GRASS history
       structure currently allows 50 lines of 80 characters  each.   But  when
       editing  history using r.support, only 20 lines of 65 characters may be
       used.
