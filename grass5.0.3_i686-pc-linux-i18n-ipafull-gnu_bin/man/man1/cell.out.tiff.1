       cceellll..oouutt..ttiiffff  -  Plots maps with the Cell Driver and exports them as a
       tiff-image.

DDeessccrriippttiioonn
       cceellll..oouutt..ttiiffff consists of a TCLTK-Module and a shell script.  With  the
       TCLTK-Module you can choose various maps (raster, vector and sites) and
       some parameters. The script creates a set of display commands and plots
       the  chosen  maps as a preview in the selected monitor. Then the script
       initializes the cell driver and  plots  all  the  maps  to  D_Cell  and
       exports  the D_Cell-map as a tiff-file. Finally the script restores the
       previous settings.


       It is the attempt to collect as many of the most  common  display  com-
       mands as possible in a single command and to hide some awkward commands
       (e.g. changing projections for the export) from the user.


       The maps will be displayed in the following order:


       Base raster map -> additional raster maps -> vector polygons ->  vector
       maps -> site maps ->; legend.


       You can see all the commands as they are created from the shell script,
       so if the result doesn't look like what you've expected, you  can  see,
       what  parameters might be wrong. All messages from the display commands
       are displayed, too. The user can use additional  display  commands,  if
       the  pause  option  was set. The script waits until the xterm window is
       closed, so you can use any display command, you might need.

EEnnttrriieess
       BBaacckkggrroouunndd ccoolloorr - Sets the background color with d.erase.  The default
       is  set  to  white, as the exported files are probably used for printed
       maps. This is different to the default behavior of d.erase.


       RRaasstteerr mmaappss

       BBaassee rraasstteerr mmaapp - A raster map put in the background with d.rast.


       AAddddiittiioonnaall rraasstteerr mmaappss - To display more than one raster maps. The maps
       must be separated by comma (this is automatically done, if the maps are
       chosen with the raster-button) These raster maps can be used  as  over-
       lays  by  activating the overlay-button.  This option is similar to the
       overlay option of d.rast.


       VVeeccttoorr mmaappss

       VVeeccttoorr ppoollyyggoonn mmaappss - displays vector polygon maps with d.area. You can
       select  border  colors  and  fill colors for each map with the next two
       entries. The first map will be plotted with the first colors, the  sec-
       ond  with  the second and so on. All maps with no color will be plotted
       with the default colors.


       VVeeccttoorr mmaappss - displays vector maps with d.vect. You can choose the col-
       ors for the maps with the next entry: Vector display colors.


       SSiittee mmaappss - Display site markers with the d.sites command.  The parame-
       ters color, size and type can be selected with the appropriate entries.
       As  usual,  the  first entry of the parameter belongs to the first site
       map and so on.


       LLeeggeenndd - Displays a legend in the map with d.legend. You can choose the
       size with the lines entry and the font color with the color entry.


       CCeellll  ssiizzee  -  The  size  of the resulting map in pixels. This entry is
       required and cell.out.tiff will exit with an  error  message,  if  this
       field is empty.


       OOuuttppuutt ttiiffff ffiillee - The name and path of the resulting tiff image.


       PPaauussee  ffoorr  aaddddiittiioonnaall  ccoommmmaannddss  - If this check-box is activated, the
       scripts waits for additional display commands  after  the  preview  has
       been created and before the D_Cell map is exported.


       PPrreevviieeww  oonnllyy  - If this check-box is activated, no export file is cre-
       ated and the script terminates after the preview.

NNootteess
       Cell.out.tiff is a shell script, so it can easily be modified  to  suit
       your needs.

BBuuggss
       The script doesn't terminate proper, when the kill button is used.
