       _r_._p_o_l_y scans the named iinnppuutt raster map layer, extracts area edge  fea-
       tures  from it, converts data to GRASS vector format, and smoothes vec-
       tors.


       _r_._p_o_l_y first traces the perimeter of each unique area in the raster map
       layer  and creates vector data to represent it.  The cell category val-
       ues for the raster map layer will be used to create attribute  informa-
       tion for the resultant vector area edge data.


       A  true vector tracing of the area edges might appear blocky, since the
       vectors outline the edges of raster data that are stored in rectangular
       cells.   To  produce  a  better-looking vector map, _r_._p_o_l_y smoothes the
       corners of the vector data as they are being extracted. At each  change
       in  direction (i.e., each corner), the two midpoints of the corner cell
       (half the cell's height and width) are taken, and the line segment con-
       necting  them  is  used  to outline this corner in the resultant vector
       file.  (The cell's cornermost node is  ignored.)  Because  vectors  are
       smoothed  by  this program, the resulting vector map will not be "true"
       to the raster map from which it was created.  The user should check the
       resolution of the geographic region (and the original data) to estimate
       the possible error introduced by smoothing.

       The user can run this  program  either  non-interactively  or  interac-
       tively.   The  program will be run non-interactively if the user speci-
       fies program arguments and flag settings on the command line using  the
       form: rr..ppoollyy [--llccbb] iinnppuutt==_n_a_m_e oouuttppuutt==_n_a_m_e

       Alternately,  the user can simply type rr..ppoollyy on the command line with-
       out program arguments. In this case, the  user  will  be  prompted  for
       parameter  values  and  flag  settings  using the standard GRASS _p_a_r_s_e_r
       interface.

NNOOTTEESS
       _r_._p_o_l_y extracts only area edges from the named raster input  file.   If
       the  raster  file contains other data (i.e., line edges, or point data)
       the output may be wrong. Using _-_b the area borders (vector  line  type)
       are written instead of the areas (vector area type). This may be useful
       for buffering of area borders and other analysis.


       The user must run _v_._s_u_p_p_o_r_t on the resultant file to build  the  needed
       topology information stored in the _d_i_g___p_l_u_s file.
