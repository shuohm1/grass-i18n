       _T_h_e  _t_y_p_e  is the type of format at which the user wishes to create the
       flow direction map. The _a_g_n_p_s format gives category  values  from  1-8,
       with  1  facing north and increasing values in the clockwise direction.
       The _a_n_s_w_e_r_s format gives category values from  0-360  degrees,  with  0
       (360) facing east and values increasing in the counter clockwise direc-
       tion at 45 degree increments. The _g_r_a_s_s format gives the same  category
       values as the _r_._s_l_o_p_e_._a_s_p_e_c_t program.


       _T_h_e  _m_e_t_h_o_d adopted to filter the elevation map and rectify it is based
       on the paper titled "Software Tools to Extract Structure  from  Digital
       Elevation Data for Geographic Information System Analysis" by S.K. Jen-
       son and J.O. Domingue (1988).


       The procedure takes an elevation layer as input and initially fills all
       the depressions with one pass across the layer. Next the flow direction
       algorithm tries to find a unique direction for each cell. If the water-
       shed program detects areas with pothholes, it delineates this area from
       the rest of the area and once again the depressions  are  filled  using
       the  neighborhood  technique  used  by  the flow direction routine. The
       final output will be a depressionless elevation layer and a unique flow
       direction layer.


       This  (D8)  flow algorithm performs as follows: At each raster cell the
       code determines the slope to  each  of  the  8  surrounding  cells  and
       assigns  the  flow  direction to the highest slope out of the cell.  If
       there is more than one equal, non-zero slope then the  code  picks  one
       direction  based  on  preferences that are hard-coded into the program.
       If the highest slope is flat and in more than one  direction  then  the
       code  first  tries to select an alternative based on flow directions in
       the adjacent cells.  It iteratives that process, effectively  propagat-
       ing  flow directions from areas where the directions are known into the
       area where the flow direction can't otherwise be resolved.


       The flow direction map can be encoded in either ANSWERS (Beasley et.al,
       1982) or AGNPS (Young et.al, 1985) form, so that it can be readily used
       as input to these hydrologic models. The resulting depressionless  ele-
       vation  layer  can further be manipulated for deriving slopes and other
       attributes required by the hydrologic models.


       In case of local problems, those unfilled areas can be  stored  option-
       ally.   Each  unfilled  area  in  this  maps is numbered. The flag _"_-_f_"
       instructs the program to fill single-cell pits but  otherwise  to  just
       find  the  undrained areas and exit. With the _"_-_f_" flag set the program
       writes an elevation map with just single-cell pits filled, a  direction
       map with unresolved problems and a map of the undrained areas that were
       found but not filled. This option was included because filling DEMs was
       often  not  the best way to solve a drainage problem. These options let
       the user get a partially-fixed elevation map,  identify  the  remaining
       problems and fix the problems appropriately.

NNOOTTEE
       _T_h_e _r_._f_i_l_l_._d_i_r program is sensitive to the ccuurrrreenntt wwiinnddooww sseettttiinngg. Thus
       the program can be used to generate a flow direction map for  any  sub-
       area  within  the  full map layer. Also, _r_._f_i_l_l_._d_i_r is sensitive to any
       _m_a_s_k in effect.


       In some cases it may be necessary to run r.fill.dir  repeatedly  (using
       output  from  one  run  as input to the next run) before all of problem
       areas are filled.
