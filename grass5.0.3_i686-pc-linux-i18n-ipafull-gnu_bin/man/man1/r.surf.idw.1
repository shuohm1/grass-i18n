       _r_._s_u_r_f_._i_d_w  fills  a grid cell (raster) matrix with interpolated values
       generated from a set of input layer data points. It  uses  a  numerical
       approximation technique based on distance squared weighting of the val-
       ues of nearest data points. The number of nearest data points  used  to
       determined  the  interpolated  value  of a cell can be specified by the
       user (default: 12 nearest data points).


       If there is a current working mask, it applies  to  the  output  raster
       file.  Only those cells falling within the mask will be assigned inter-
       polated values. The search  procedure  for  the  selection  of  nearest
       neighboring  points will consider all input data, without regard to the
       mask.

       The command line input is as follows:

   FFllaagg::
       --ee     Error analysis option that interpolates values  only  for  those
              cells  of  the  input  raster map which have non-zero values and
              outputs the difference (see NOTES below).


   PPaarraammeetteerrss::
       iinnppuutt==_n_a_m_e
              Name of an input raster map layer containing an  incomplete  set
              of data values. (i.e., some grid cells contain known data values
              while the rest contain zero (0)).

       oouuttppuutt==_n_a_m_e
              Name to be assigned to new output raster map that represents the
              surface generated from the known data values in the input layer.

       nnppooiinnttss==_v_a_l_u_e
              Number of nearest data points used to determine the interpolated
              value of an output raster cell.
              Default: 12


NNOOTTEESS
       _r_._s_u_r_f_._i_d_w  is a surface generation utility which uses inverse distance
       squared weighting (as described  in  AApppplliieedd  GGeeoossttaattiissttiiccss  by  E.  H.
       Isaaks  and R. M.  Srivastava, Oxford University Press, 1989) to assign
       interpolated values. The  implementation  includes  a  customized  data
       structure  somewhat  akin  to  a sparse matrix which enhances the effi-
       ciency with which nearest data points are selected.  For  latitude/lon-
       gitude  projections, distances are calculated from point to point along
       a geodesic.


       Unlike _r_._s_u_r_f_._i_d_w_2, which processes  all  input  data  points  in  each
       interpolation  cycle,  _r_._s_u_r_f_._i_d_w  attempts  to  minimize the number of
       input data for which distances must be calculated.  Execution speed  is
       therefore a function of the search effort, and does not increase appre-
       ciably with the number of input data points.


       _r_._s_u_r_f_._i_d_w will generally outperform _r_._s_u_r_f_._i_d_w_2 except when the  input
       data layer contains few non-zero data, i.e. when the cost of the search
       exceeds the cost of the additional distance calculations  performed  by
       _r_._s_u_r_f_._i_d_w_2.   The  relative performance of these utilities will depend
       on the comparative speed of boolean, integer and floating point  opera-
       tions on a particular platform.


       Worst  case  search  performance by _r_._s_u_r_f_._i_d_w occurs when the interpo-
       lated cell is located outside of the region in  which  input  data  are
       distributed.  It therefore behooves the user to employ a mask when geo-
       graphic region boundaries  include  large  areas  outside  the  general
       extent of the input data.


       The  degree  of  smoothing  produced by the interpolation will increase
       relative to the number of nearest data points considered.  The  utility
       may  be used with regularly or irregularly spaced input data.  However,
       the output result for the former may include unacceptable  nonconformi-
       ties in the surface pattern.


       The  --ee flag option provides a standard surface-generation error analy-
       sis facility. It produces an output raster map  of  the  difference  of
       interpolated values minus input values for those cells whose input data
       are non-zero. For each interpolation cycle, the known value of the cell
       under consideration is ignored, and the remaining input values are used
       to interpolate a result. The output raster map may be compared  to  the
       input  raster  map  to analyze the distribution of interpolation error.
       This procedure may be helpful in choosing the number of nearest  neigh-
       bors considered for surface generation.
