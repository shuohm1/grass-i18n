       _s_._s_u_r_f_._i_d_w fills a raster matrix  with  interpolated  values  generated
       from a set of irregularly spaced data points using numerical approxima-
       tion (weighted averaging) techniques. The interpolated value of a  cell
       is  determined  by values of nearby data points and the distance of the
       cell from those input points.  In comparison with other methods, numer-
       ical approximation allows representation of more complex surfaces (par-
       ticularly those with anomalous features), restricts the spatial  influ-
       ence  of  any  errors,  and generates the interpolated surface from the
       data points.


       This program allows the user to use a GRASS site list file, rather than
       a raster map layer, as input.


       The  program  will  be  run non-interactively if the user specifies the
       values of needed program parameters and any desired optional  parameter
       values on the command line, using the form:


       ss..ssuurrff..iiddww [[--nn]] iinnppuutt==_n_a_m_e oouuttppuutt==_n_a_m_e [[nnppooiinnttss==_c_o_u_n_t]] [[ffiieelldd==_n_u_m_b_e_r]]

       Alternately,  the  user can simply type ss..ssuurrff..iiddww on the command line,
       without program arguments. In this case, the user will be prompted  for
       needed inputs and option choices using the standard GRASS _p_a_r_s_e_r inter-
       face.

       The  amount  of memory used by this program is related to the number of
       sites in the current region.  If the site list  is  very  dense  (i.e.,
       contains  many data points), the program may not be able to get all the
       memory it needs from the system.   The  time  required  to  execute  is
       related to the resolution of the current region, after an initial delay
       determined by the time taken to read the input sites file.


       If the user has a mask set, then interpolation is only done  for  those
       cells  that  fall  within  the  mask. However, all sites in the current
       region are used even if they fall outside the mask. Sites  outside  the
       current  region  are not used in the interpolation. A larger region may
       be set and a mask used to limit interpolation to a smaller area  if  it
       is desired to use sites from outside the region in the interpolation.


       If  more than _c_o_u_n_t sites fall into one target raster cell, the mean of
       all the site values will determine the cell value (unless the  -n  flag
       is  specifed,  in which case only the _c_o_u_n_t sites closest to the centre
       of the cell will be interpolated).
