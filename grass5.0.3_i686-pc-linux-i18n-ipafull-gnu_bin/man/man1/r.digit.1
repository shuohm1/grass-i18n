       The GRASS tool _r_._d_i_g_i_t provides the user with  a  way  to  draw  lines,
       areas, and circles on a monitor screen, and to save these features in a
       cell file.  Lines, areas, and circles are to be drawn using a  pointing
       device  (mouse).   A  mouse  button  menu indicates the consequences of
       pressing each mouse button.  The user is requested to enter  the  cate-
       gory  number  associated  with  the  line, area, or circle subsequently
       drawn by the user.  Lines, areas, and circles are defined by the series
       of points marked by the user inside the map window.  _r_._d_i_g_i_t will close
       areas when the user has not.  By drawing a series of such features, the
       user can repair maps, identify areas of interest, or simply draw graph-
       ics for advertisement.  When drawing is completed, a raster  map  based
       on  the user's instructions is generated.  It is available for use as a
       mask, in analyses, and for display.


       Digitizing is done in a "polygon" method.  Each area  is  circumscribed
       completely.   Two or more areas and/or lines might define a single part
       of a map.  Each part of the map, however, is  assigned  only  the  LAST
       area or line which covered it.

   TTHHEE PPRROOCCEESSSS::
              Choose to define an area or line, quit, or finish.  If you quit,
              the session exits with nothing created.  If you choose to finish
              (_d_o_n_e), you will be prompted for a new map name;  the new map is
              then created.

              If you choose to make an area or line you must identify the cat-
              egory number for that area or line.

              Using  the  mouse  trace  the line or circumscribe the area; or,
              finish (go to Step 1).
