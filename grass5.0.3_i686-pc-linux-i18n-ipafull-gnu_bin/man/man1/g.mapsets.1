       A _m_a_p_s_e_t holds a distinct set of data layers, each relevant to the same
       (or a subset of the same) geographic region, and each drawn in the same
       map  coordinate system.  At the outset of every GRASS session, the user
       identifies a GRASS data base, location, and mapset that are to  be  the
       user's  _c_u_r_r_e_n_t _d_a_t_a _b_a_s_e, _c_u_r_r_e_n_t _l_o_c_a_t_i_o_n, and _c_u_r_r_e_n_t _m_a_p_s_e_t for the
       duration of the session; any maps created by the user during  the  ses-
       sion  will be stored under the _c_u_r_r_e_n_t _m_a_p_s_e_t ($MAPSET) set at the ses-
       sion's outset.


       The user can add, modify, and delete data layers that exist  under  his
       _c_u_r_r_e_n_t  _m_a_p_s_e_t.   Although  the  user can also _a_c_c_e_s_s (i.e., use) data
       that are stored under _o_t_h_e_r mapsets in the  same  GRASS  location,  the
       user can only make permanent changes (create or modify data) located in
       the _c_u_r_r_e_n_t _m_a_p_s_e_t.  The user's _m_a_p_s_e_t _s_e_a_r_c_h _p_a_t_h lists the  order  in
       which  other  mapsets  in  the  same GRASS location can be searched and
       their data accessed by the user.  The user can modify the  listing  and
       order  in  which  these  mapsets  are  accessed by modifying the mapset
       search path; this can be done using the _g_._m_a_p_s_e_t_s command.   This  pro-
       gram  allows the user to use other's relevant map data without altering
       the original data layer, and without taking up disk space with  a  copy
       of the original map.


       _g_._m_a_p_s_e_t_s  shows  the  user  available  mapsets under the current GRASS
       location, lists mapsets to which the user  currently  has  access,  and
       lists  the  order in which accessible mapsets will be accessed by GRASS
       programs searching for data files.  The user is then given the opportu-
       nity  to add or delete mapset names from his search path, or modify the
       order in which mapsets will be accessed.


       When the user specifies the name of a data base element file  (e.g.,  a
       particular  vector  file,  raster file, imagery group file, etc.)  to a
       GRASS program, the program searches for the named file  under  each  of
       the mapsets listed in the user's mapset search path in the order listed
       there until the program finds a file of the  given  name.   (Users  can
       also  specify  a  file  by its mapset, to make explicit the mapset from
       which  the  file  is  to  be  drawn;    e.g.,   the   command:   gg..ccooppyy
       rraasstt==_'_s_o_i_l_s_._f_i_l_e_@_P_E_R_M_A_N_E_N_T_'_,_m_y_._s_o_i_l_s

       ensures  that  a  new  file  named _m_y_._s_o_i_l_s is to be a copy of the file
       _s_o_i_l_s_._f_i_l_e from the mapset PERMANENT.)


       It is common for a user to have the special mapset  PPEERRMMAANNEENNTT  included
       in  his  mapset search path, as this mapset typically contains finished
       base maps relevant to many applications.  Often,  other  mapsets  which
       contain sets of interpreted map layers will be likewise included in the
       user's mapset search path.   Suppose,  for  example,  that  the  mapset
       _S_o_i_l___M_a_p_s contains interpreted soils map layers to which the user wants
       access.  The mapset _S_o_i_l___M_a_p_s should then be  included  in  the  user's
       _s_e_a_r_c_h _p_a_t_h variable.


       The  _m_a_p_s_e_t  _s_e_a_r_c_h  _p_a_t_h is saved as part of the current mapset.  When
       the user works with that mapset in subsequent GRASS sessions, the  pre-
       viously  saved mapset search path will be used (and will continue to be
       used until it is modified by the user with _g_._m_a_p_s_e_t_s).

       _g_._m_a_p_s_e_t_s sets the current _m_a_p_s_e_t _s_e_a_r_c_h _p_a_t_h to the _m_a_p_s_e_t_s  named  on
       the command line.  If gg..mmaappsseettss is typed but no _m_a_p_s_e_t names are speci-
       fied by the user on the command line, the program will print the user's
       current mapset search path, list available mapsets, and prompt the user
       for a new mapset search path listing.


       The _a_d_d_m_a_p_s_e_t parameter allows for extending an existing _m_a_p_s_e_t  _s_e_a_r_c_h
       _p_a_t_h.

       Users  can restrict others' access to their mapset files through use of
       the GRASS program _g_._a_c_c_e_s_s.  Mapsets to which access is restricted  can
       still  be  listed  in  another's mapset search path; however, access to
       these mapsets will remain restricted.
