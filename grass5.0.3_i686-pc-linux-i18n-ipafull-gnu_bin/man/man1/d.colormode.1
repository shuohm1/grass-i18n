       played using its own color table or the fixed color table of the graph-
       ics monitor.

       _d_._c_o_l_o_r_m_o_d_e  establishes  what color table will be used to display maps
       to the graphics monitor.

       Each time a new raster map layer is drawn on the screen, a color  table
       associated  with  that map is loaded into the graphics display monitor.
       The command dd..ccoolloorrmmooddee mmooddee==ffiixxeedd requests that  the  monitor's  color
       look-up table be _f_i_x_e_d (i.e., static).  The effect is that colors drawn
       on the screen by graphics calls will not change  when  subsequent  maps
       are  drawn to the screen.  When the _f_i_x_e_d option is used, the colors in
       the map's color table are mapped to the nearest colors available in the
       monitor's  fixed color table.  When the _f_l_o_a_t option is used, the map's
       color table is loaded directly into the monitor's color look-up  table.


       There  are  advantages  to using each color display mode. The _d_._d_i_s_p_l_a_y
       and _d_._c_o_l_o_r_s programs allow the user to interactively modify the  color
       tables  of  maps  displayed  to  the graphics monitor.  This is done by
       allowing the user to directly modify the monitor's color look-up table.
       Hence, to accommodate this option in _d_._c_o_l_o_r_s, the _f_l_o_a_t option is cho-
       sen.  However, this option has  the  sometimes  undesirable  effect  of
       changing  the  colors in which other maps are subsequently displayed to
       the graphics monitor (although it does not actually  change  the  _c_o_l_o_r
       _t_a_b_l_e_s  of  these  latter maps).  The _f_l_o_a_t colormode is therefore best
       used when the user wishes to interactively change a map's color  table,
       or  when  the  user  wishes to display one or more maps having the same
       color table.  The _f_i_x_e_d option allows any number of  maps  to  be  dis-
       played to the screen, where each map uses different colors, but all use
       the same fixed color look-up table.  You cannot toggle  a  map's  color
       table when running in fixed mode.


       This  program  will  be run non-interactively if the user specifies the
       color _m_o_d_e on the command line (e.g., by typing dd..ccoolloorrmmooddee  mmooddee==ffiixxeedd
       or  dd..ccoolloorrmmooddee  mmooddee==ffllooaatt).   Alternately,  if  the user simply types
       dd..ccoolloorrmmooddee on the command line, the program will prompt the  user  for
       the color mode using the standard GRASS _p_a_r_s_e_r interface.

NNOOTTEESS
       Some devices support only a fixed color look-up. Whether or not XDRIVER
       supports float mode depends upon the X display in use; modes with  more
       than  256  colors  usually only support fixed mode. The number of color
       categories capable of being displayed is also device-dependent; if your
       colors fall outside this range when in _f_l_o_a_t mode, they may not be _d_i_s_-
       _p_l_a_y_e_d in the colors indicated in the map's color table file.  However,
       the  color  table files themselves will accurately represent the user's
       changes.


       Color table files associated with raster map layers are stored  in  the
       user's current mapset under the _c_o_l_r and _c_o_l_r_2 directories.

BBUUGGSS
       It  is  strongly  recommended  that the user erase the graphics monitor
       screen (e.g., by running _d_._e_r_a_s_e) immediately after changing  the  mode
       between _f_i_x_e_d and _f_l_o_a_t_.
