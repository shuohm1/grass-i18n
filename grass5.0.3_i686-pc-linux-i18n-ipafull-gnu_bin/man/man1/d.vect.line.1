              egory (see below). If "-" is specified, the legend will be  read
              from standard input.  Default: none

       Use  _d_._v_e_c_t_._l_i_n_e  to draw labelled lines from a vector map to the GRASS
       display.  By default, _d_._v_e_c_t_._l_i_n_e will draw all labelled lines  in  the
       vector  map with white.  The lines drawn may be restricted via the _c_a_t_-
       _n_u_m argument or by using a _l_e_g_e_n_d file.


       The _c_o_l_o_r argument may be any of the standard named  GRASS  colors,  or
       and  RGB (red, green, blue) triplet.  An RGB triplet must have the form
       _:_:_<_;_n_u_m_>_; where _n_u_m is between 0 and 255.


       An optional list of category numbers may  be  used  to  restrict  which
       lines are drawn (option ignored if a _l_e_g_e_n_d option is given).


       More control can be had by creating a _l_e_g_e_n_d file.  At the time of this
       writing, GRASS does not have any management  functions  for  specifying
       how  vectors  should  be drawn, so this file must be created by "hand".
       The easiest way to create such a file, is to copy the category file for
       the  vector map, and edit it to contain color specifications.  The for-
       mat of the _l_e_g_e_n_d file is _c_a_t_e_g_o_r_y _r_e_d _g_r_e_e_n _b_l_u_e, with one  entry  per
       line.   If  a  category for a map is not included in this file, it will
       not be drawn unless there is a special "default" entry with a  category
       of -1.

       EExxaammppllee LLeeggeenndd FFiillee
              -1 255 255 255

              1  210 198 168

              5  168 198 220




       In the above, all labelled lines will be drawn in white (255, 255, 255)
       except those labelled as categories 1 or 5.  If the "default" entry had
       been omitted, then only lines labelled 1 or 5 would have been drawn.


       One  may  place  comments on any line in the legend file by starting it
       with a non-numeric character ('#' is a good choice).  Empty  lines  are
       ignored.

       It is expected that the legend specification aspect of this module will
       change when an infrastructure for managing  vector  drawing  styles  is
       implemented.
