       This program has been used to import vector files that were in  scanner
       or  digitizer (x,y) coordinates and to transform these into UTM coordi-
       nates.

       ppooiinnttssffiillee==_n_a_m_e
              Name of a file containing transformation points, whose format is
              given  below.  Give a full path name for this file or it will be
              assumed to be located in the user's current directory.

       The user can run this program non-interactively by specifying parameter
       values (and optionally, the flag setting) on the command line.


       If  the  user  runs vv..ttrraannssffoorrmm without specifying program arguments on
       the command line, the program will prompt the user  for  inputs.   When
       the program prompts the user for two sets of transformation points, the
       first set of points entered by the user should  be  in  the  coordinate
       system  of the input map, and the second set of points should represent
       the corresponding geographic points in the coordinate system into which
       the  map  will  transformed.   A user must enter 4 to 10 of each set of
       points for the transformation to work correctly.


       After the user has entered both sets of points, the program  will  show
       the  amount  of  error  associated with the transformation of the given
       points as the _r_e_s_i_d_u_a_l _m_e_a_n _a_v_e_r_a_g_e (RMS).  (An acceptable  RMS  for  a
       1:24,000 UTM map would be 1.2 to 2.4 (meters).) It will then ask if the
       transformation RMS value is acceptable.  After an RMS  is  accepted  by
       the  user,  _v_._t_r_a_n_s_f_o_r_m  will transform the binary vector (_d_i_g) map and
       its associated attribute (_d_i_g___a_t_t) file into the  requested  coordinate
       system.


       Remember to run _v_._s_u_p_p_o_r_t on the output map.

       When  rectifying  a map to another coordinate system using _v_._t_r_a_n_s_f_o_r_m,
       the user should specify the coordinates of between 4 to 10 points,  and
       state  these  both  in  the  coordinate systems of the input and output
       maps.  The two sets of coordinates can be input to _v_._t_r_a_n_s_f_o_r_m interac-
       tively,  or  from a file specified on the command line with the _p_o_i_n_t_s_-
       _f_i_l_e option.  The _p_o_i_n_t_s_f_i_l_e option is especially useful  when  several
       maps  in  the same geographic area require transformation, as it elimi-
       nates the necessity for the user to repeatedly type in the same  trans-
       formation coordinates.


       A  _p_o_i_n_t_s_f_i_l_e  file  will contain between 4 to 10 lines; each line will
       contain the set of coordinate transformation points for the  input  map
       and  the corresponding set of coordinates for the output map. The mini-
       mum number of lines for the transformation to take place is four.


       The format of the _p_o_i_n_t_s_f_i_l_e file is shown below:
        Input Map   Output Map

        x       y   x        y
        x       y   x        y
        x       y   x        y
        x       y   x        y

       In the format shown above the _x's and _y's can be thought of as eastings
       and  northings, depending on what coordinate systems you are transform-
       ing to and from.


       An example of the _p_o_i_n_t_s_f_i_l_e file:
        1       1       589000   4913000
        1       17000   589000   4930000
        17000   17000   610000   4930000
        17000   1       610000   4913000

       Within the _p_o_i_n_t_s_f_i_l_e file, numbers on a line must be spaced apart with
       tabs  or  blanks.  The example shown above was used to convert a map in
       digitizer coordinates (range of 1-18000) to UTM coordinates within  the
       UTM zone for the Spearfish sample data base location.


       Because  this  _p_o_i_n_t_s_f_i_l_e  file  is not your usual GRASS data file, the
       user will have to keep track of where it is on the  system.   When  the
       _p_o_i_n_t_s_f_i_l_e  option is used on the command line to input the transforma-
       tion points, the program does not ask  whether  or  not  everything  is
       acceptable before converting the vector file and the attribute file.


       The  user  is advised to run this program interactively with a specific
       set of transformation coordinates and to examine the resulting  residu-
       als,  to  determine how accurate the transformation will be (i.e., pick
       points with known values in both coordinate systems).  After the resid-
       uals  are acceptable, those transformation coordinates can be used with
       the program run non-interactively to transform other maps in  the  same
       geographic area.

WWAARRNNIINNGG
       This  is  a  general  purpose program and can be fooled into giving low
       residuals. It is strongly suggested that any transformed map be checked
       for  accuracy.  The program assumes that the coordinate systems will be
       planimetric and has never been tested with negative values.


       If this program is being used to transform maps from State Plane to UTM
       coordinates,  and  vice  versa,  users should be aware of the following
       points.  This program will work better with State Plane zones that  use
       the  Transverse  Mercator  projection. Those are states that have their
       state zones  splitting  the  state  vertically,  like  Illinois.   This
       program  will not work as well with states that use the Lambert Confor-
       mal Conic projection. Those are states  that  have  their  state  zones
       splitting  the  state  horizontally, like Wisconsin. It is also best to
       keep the area being transformed relatively small.
