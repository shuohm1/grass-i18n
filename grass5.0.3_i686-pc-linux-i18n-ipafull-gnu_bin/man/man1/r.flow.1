       This  program  generates  flowlines  using  a  combined   raster-vector
       approach  (see  Mitasova  and  Hofierka 1993 and Mitasova et al. 1995))
       from an input elevation raster map _e_l_e_v_i_n (integer or floating  point),
       and optionally an input aspect raster map _a_s_p_i_n and/or an input barrier
       raster map _b_a_r_i_n. There are three possible output  maps  which  can  be
       produced  in  any  combination  simultaneously:  a vector file _f_l_o_u_t of
       flowlines, a raster map _l_g_o_u_t of flowpath lengths,  and  a  raster  map
       _d_s_o_u_t  of flowline densities (which are equal upslope contributed areas
       per unit width, when multiplied by resolution).

       Aspect used for input must follow the same rules as aspect computed  in
       other GRASS programs (see s.surf.rst or r.slope.aspect).

       Flowline  output  is  given in a vector map _f_l_o_u_t, (flowlines generated
       downhill). The line segments of  flowline  vectors  have  endpoints  on
       edges  of  a grid formed by drawing imaginary lines through the centers
       of the cells in the elevation map. Flowlines are  generated  from  each
       cell  downhill  by default; they can be generated uphill using the flag
       _-_u. A flowline stops if its next segment would reverse the direction of
       flow  (from  up to down or vice-versa), cross a barrier, or arrive at a
       cell with undefined elevation  or  aspect.  Another  option,  _s_k_i_p=val,
       indicates  that  only  the  flowlines  from every val-th cell are to be
       included in _f_l_o_u_t.  The default _s_k_i_p is max(1, /50, /50).  A high  _s_k_i_p
       usually speeds up processing time and often improves the readability of
       a visualization of _f_l_o_u_t.

       Flowpath length output is given in a raster map  _l_g_o_u_t.  The  value  in
       each  grid cell is the sum of the planar lengths of all segments of the
       flowline generated from that cell. If the flag _-_3 is  given,  elevation
       is taken into account in calculating the length of each segment.

       Flowline  density  downhill  or  uphill output is given in a raster map
       _d_s_o_u_t_. The value in each grid cell is the  number  of  flowlines  which
       pass  through  that  grid cell, that means the number of flowlines from
       the entire map which have segment endpoints within that cell.

       The program will run non-interactively  if the user  specifies  program
       arguments  and  flag  settings  on the command line using the following
       form:

       rr..ffllooww [[ --uu33mmMMqqhh ]] eelleevviinn = name [ aassppiinn = name ] [ bbaarriinn =  name  ]  [
       sskkiipp  = val ] [ bboouunndd = val ] [ ooffffsseett = val ] [ fflloouutt = name ] [ llggoouutt
       = name ] [ ddssoouutt = name ].

       Alternatively, the user can simply type rr..ffllooww on the command line  and
       the  program  will  ask for parameter values and flag settings interac-
       tively, using the standard GRASS parser interface.

       --33 Compute three-dimensional lengths (default is two-dimensional).

       option  incurs a severe performance penalty. If this flag is given, the
       aspect input map (if any) will be ignored.

       --MM Use a fixed size memory and utilize page-swapping  to  handle  large

       only way to handle arbitrarily-large data files. If this flag is given,

       For best results, use input elevation maps with  high  precision  units
       (e.g.,  centimeters)  so that flowlines do not terminate prematurely in
       flat areas.  To prevent the creation of  tiny  flowline  segments  with
       imperceivable  changes  in elevation, an endpoint which would land very
       close to the center of a grid cell is quantized to the exact center  of
       that  cell. The maximum distance between the intercepts along each axis
       of a single diagonal segment and another segment of 1/2 degree  differ-
       ent  aspect  is  taken to be "very close" for that axis. Note that this
       distance (the so-called "quantization error") is about 1-2% of the res-
       olution on maps with square cells.

       The values in length maps computed using the --uu flag represent the dis-
       tances from each cell to an upland flat or singular  point.  Such  dis-
       tances  are  useful in water erosion modeling for computation of the LS
       factor in the standard form of USLE. Uphill flowlines  merge  on  ridge
       lines;  by  redirecting  the order of the flowline points in the output
       vector map, dispersed waterflow can be simulated. The density  map  can
       be used for the extraction of ridge lines.

       Computing  the flowlines downhill simulates the actual flow (also known
       as the raindrop method). These flowlines tend to merge in valleys; they
       can  be  used for localization of areas with waterflow accumulation and
       for the extraction of channels. The downslope flowline  density  multi-
       plied  by the resolution can be used as an approximation of the upslope
       contributing area per unit contour width. This area  is  a  measure  of
       potential water flux for the steady state conditions and can be used in
       the modeling of water erosion for the computation of  the  unit  stream
       power based LS factor or sediment transport capacity.

       The  program  has  been designed for modeling erosion on hillslopes and
       has rather strict conditions for ending flowlines. It is therefore  not
       very  suitable  for the extraction of stream networks or delineation of
       watersheds unless a  DEM  without  pits  or  flat  areas  is  available
       (r.fill.dir can be used to fill pits).

        To  label  the vector flowlines automatically, the user can use v.lla-
       bel.

       1. Construction of flow-lines (slope-lines): r.flow  uses  an  original
       vector-grid  algorithm  which  uses  an  infinite  number of directions
       between 0.0000... and 360.0000...  and traces the flow as a line  (vec-
       tor) in the direction of gradient (rather than from cell to cell in one
       of the 8 directions = D-infinity algorithm). They  are  traced  in  any
       direction  using  aspect  (so  there  is  no limitation to 8 directions
       here). The D8 algorithm produces zig-zag lines. The value in the outlet
       is  very similar for both r.flow and r.flowmd algorithms (because it is
       essentially the watershed area), however the  spatial  distribution  of
       flow,  especially  on  hillslopes  is quite different. It is still a 1D
       flow routing so the dispersal flow is  not  accurately  described,  but
       still better than D8.

       2.  Computation  of contributing areas: r.flow uses a single flow algo-
       rithm, i.e. all flow is transported to a single cell downslope.

       Differences between _r_._f_l_o_w and _r_._f_l_o_w_m_d



               r.flow has an option to compute  slope  and  aspect  internally
              thus making the program capable to process much larger data sets
              than r.flowmd. It has also 2 additional options for handling  of
              large data sets but it is not known that they work properly.

               the  programs handle the special cases when the flowline passes
              exactly (or very close) through the grid vertices differently.

               r.flowmd has the  simplified  multiple  flow  addition  so  the
              results are smoother.

       In  conclusion,  _r_._f_l_o_w_m_d  produces  nicer results but is slower and it
       does not support as large data sets as _r_._f_l_o_w.
