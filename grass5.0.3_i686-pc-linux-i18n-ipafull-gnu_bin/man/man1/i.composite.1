       _i_._c_o_m_p_o_s_i_t_e creates a color composite image from three band files spec-
       ified  by the user.  The user specifies the bands to be used by assign-
       ing a red, blue, and/or green color to each band.  The resulting  image
       is  a raster map layer of raw spectral data composed of the three bands
       chosen by the  user.   The  color  composite  can  then  be  displayed,
       painted, or manipulated as would any raster map layer in GRASS.


       The first prompt asks the user for the imagery group whose files are to
       be used.


       The following menu is then displayed:
       Please indicate which files to use for red, green, and blue
       colors.  You may leave any color out.  You may specify more
       than one color per file.  However, each color may only be
       specified once.  For example, to get a full color image,
       specify r,g,b for 3 different files.  To get a grey scale
       image, specify rgb for a single file.

                            b__    spot.1
                            g__    spot.2
                            r__    spot.3
                            ___    spotclass
                            ___    spotreject

           AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT <ESC> TO CONTINUE
                         (OR <Ctrl-C> TO CANCEL)

       The user is then allowed to check the choice of bands:
                      Colors assigned as follows:

                        RED:     spot.3@mapsetname
                        GREEN:   spot.2@mapsetname
                        BLUE:    spot.1@mapsetname

                            Look ok? (y/n) [y]

                      How many color levels (number of colors = levels^3)? 10

       If the number of color levels is set to 10, the  color  table  that  is
       created  has  1000 colors (10 saturation levels (or shades) per primary
       color (blue, green, red)).  The number of colors that can be  displayed
       at  one  time  on  a color graphics monitor will depend on the graphics
       monitor being used. Note that GRASS currently becomes very slow in dis-
       playing  maps with more than 8000 colors (color level: 20). So 10 to 15
       color levels are recommended.


       The user is then asked to name the composite image  raster  map  layer.
       The  percentage  completed  is echoed to the screen and _r_._s_u_p_p_o_r_t files
       are created automatically.

       The user should always check the geographic region settings before run-
       ning  most imagery commands.  It is very easy for the boundaries of the
       geographic region to be  completely  off  the  image.   Before  running
       _i_._c_o_m_p_o_s_i_t_e,  or  other  imagery commands, the user should probably set
       the geographic region to match that of the  raster  map  layers  to  be
       read.  This can be accomplished using option 4 of the _g_._r_e_g_i_o_n command.


       This program is interactive and requires no command line arguments.
