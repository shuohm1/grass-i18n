       A color table file associates specific colors with the categories of  a
       raster  map layer. The user can change these map category color assign-
       ments (i.e., change the map's color table) interactively, by first dis-
       playing  the  raster  map  to the graphics monitor and then running the
       program _d_._c_o_l_o_r_s.  If you have first set _d_._c_o_l_o_r_m_o_d_e to "float"  before
       displaying  the map to the graphics monitor, any color changes that you
       subsequently make while in  _d_._c_o_l_o_r_s  will  immediately  (and  interac-
       tively) appear on the graphics display.


       While running _d_._c_o_l_o_r_s
        the  cursor must be inside the window where the execution takes place.
       When in "float" colormode, the correct colors appear  on  the  graphics
       monitor  only  if the cursor is inside the monitor.  To see the correct
       colors, move the cursor from the execution window to inside the  graph-
       ics monitor, then move back to the window to continue making changes.


       If  _d_._c_o_l_o_r_m_o_d_e  is "fixed", any color changes made using _d_._c_o_l_o_r_s will
       not immediately be shown on the graphics display;  however,  any  color
       changes  saved  will  still alter the map's color table and will appear
       next time the raster map layer is redisplayed (see _d_._c_o_l_o_r_t_a_b_l_e).  Note
       that  some graphics display monitors or drivers cannot support interac-
       tive color change.


       The user must first display the relevant raster map layer to the active
       frame  on  the  graphics monitor (e.g., using _d_._d_i_s_p_l_a_y) before running
       _d_._c_o_l_o_r_s.  The user can then either enter the name of  the  raster  map
       layer  whose color table is to be changed on the command line (e.g., by
       typing: dd..ccoolloorrss map=soils), or type  dd..ccoolloorrss  without  program  argu-
       ments.   If the user simply types dd..ccoolloorrss without program arguments on
       the command line, _d_._c_o_l_o_r_s will ask the user to enter the  name  of  an
       existing  raster map layer using the standard GRASS interface described
       in the manual entry for _p_a_r_s_e_r.


       In either case, the user is then presented with  the  _d_._c_o_l_o_r_s  command
       menu,  shown  below.   This  menu is the same as the category and color
       changing portion of the _d_._d_i_s_p_l_a_y  menu.   The  _d_._c_o_l_o_r_s  commands  are
       listed  beneath  the  Category  Pointer  Movement,  Color Modification,
       Replotting Screen, and Quitting sections below.  Commands  are  invoked
       by  typing  in the single-key response shown to the left below. (Longer
       descriptions of these commands appear  to  the  right.)   Results  from
       invoking  these commands will be reflected in the Category and Category
       Number sections of the _d_._c_o_l_o_r_s screen. On the  _d_._c_o_l_o_r_s  screen  menu,
       commands appear in the right half of the screen, and the current status
       of categories appears in the left half of the screen.

       Changing categories - The keys ""dd,, DD,, uu,,"" and ""UU"" are used to move to a
       different category. The lower case letters move up, uu,, and down, dd,, the
       category list one category at a time. The upper case  letters  move  10
       categories  at  a  time for fast movement. The cursor does wrap between
       the first and last categories. The current category  is  noted  on  the
       text screen with an arrow, and is indicated on the graphics screen by a
       box around the current color.


       Changing colors - The color associated with the current category can be
       changed  with  the  ""RR,, rr,, GG,, gg,, BB,,"" and bb keys. The upper case letters
       increase the intensities of red RR,, green GG,, and blue BB for the  current
       category; the lower case letters decrease the intensities of these same
       colors for the current category. Video devices make all the  colors  of
       the  spectrum  by  mixing red, green, and blue. For those accustomed to
       red, yellow, and blue being the primary colors, this can be  confusing.
       For  starters,  yellow is made by mixing red and green. The intensities
       are listed on the text screen in as percentages.


       Keys II and ii increase and decrease  the  percentage  change  that  each
       keystroke  of  one  of  the color keys (_R_, _r_, _G_, _g_, _B_, _b) causes in its
       respective color. The increase  increment  is  initially  set  to  10%.
       Thus,  pressing  the _R key would will increase the red component of the
       current category by 10%.


       Highlight - The hh key toggles between the current  category  color  and
       the  current  highlight color. This color is initially black but can be
       modified as above while in highlight mode. Blinking can be accomplished
       by repeatedly striking the hh key. When changing to different categories
       using the movement keys as described above, while in highlight mode the
       category  colors  will be always left showing their actual colors. Only
       one category is highlighted at any one time.


       Saving the current color table - Pressing the cc key will save the  cur-
       rent  color table as you have modified it. This table will then be used
       next time you display or paint this raster map layer.


       Color table toggle - Different types of color tables are  suitable  for
       different  raster  map  layers.   The key tt flips between the following
       color tables: red, green, blue color ramp; gray scale; smooth  changing
       color wave; random colors; and the saved color table.


       Color table shift - The entire table is shifted up and down using the ++
       and -- keys.


       Quitting the _d_._c_o_l_o_r_s program - Pressing the QQ key will  cause  you  to
       quit the _d_._c_o_l_o_r_s program.  If colors have been modified but not saved,
       _d_._c_o_l_o_r_s will ask:
                Colors changed
                Save the changes? (y/n)

       The user should type in yy to save changes, or nn to  not  save  changes,
       before  quitting  the  program.   If the user types nn, the program will
       ask:
                Quit anyway? (y/n)


NNOOTTEESS
       To see map color changes reflected on the display monitor as  you  make
       them,  you  must  put  the  monitor  in _f_l_o_a_t color mode before running
       _d_._c_o_l_o_r_s. It is also wise to erase the display  screen  after  changing
       the color mode.


       The  map  whose color table is to be altered with _d_._c_o_l_o_r_s must already
       be on display in the active  display  frame  on  the  graphics  monitor
       before  _d_._c_o_l_o_r_s  is  run.  This  can  be done using the command dd..rraasstt
       mmaapp==_n_a_m_e (where _n_a_m_e is a raster map layer whose color table  the  user
       wishes to alter).


       The user might type the following sequence of commands to interactively
       change the colors of a raster _s_o_i_l_s map:


       dd..ccoolloorrmmooddee mmooddee==_f_l_o_a_t dd..eerraassee dd..rraasstt mmaapp==_s_o_i_l_s dd..ccoolloorrss



       After the user has saved any  color  changes  made  with  _d_._c_o_l_o_r_s  and
       exited  the  program,  the user could then redisplay the _s_o_i_l_s map with
       the new colors by typing:


       dd..ccoolloorrmmooddee mode=fixed dd..eerraassee dd..rraasstt map=soils

       Some color monitors may not support the full range of  colors  required
       to display all of the map's categories listed in the map's color table.
       However, regardless of whether the user can see the color changes he is
       effecting  to  a  map's color table, any changes to a map's color table
       made with _d_._c_o_l_o_r_s that are saved will appear in the map's color table.


       Some monitors may not support an interactive color change capability.
