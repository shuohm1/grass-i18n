       _m_._d_e_m_._e_x_t_r_a_c_t  extracts  USGS  Digital  Elevation Model (DEM) elevation
       data that fits into the user's current geographic region from the input
       file  _i_n_p_u_t,  in blocks of _b_l_o_c_k_s_i_z_e bytes.  If no _i_n_p_u_t file is speci-
       fied by the user, input is taken from /dev/rmt0, by  default.   Results
       are placed in the named _o_u_t_p_u_t file, and stored beneath the _c_e_l_l direc-
       tory of the user's current mapset.   _m_._d_e_m_._e_x_t_r_a_c_t  will  only  extract
       data  that  fall within the boundaries of the user's current geographic
       region.   Data  falling  outside   this   region   will   be   ignored.
       _m_._d_e_m_._e_x_t_r_a_c_t  will  not  complain if the input file does not cover the
       entire geographic region.  The user should  run  _m_._d_e_m_._e_x_t_r_a_c_t  without
       specifying  output  file  (which only examines the input file) prior to
       extracting the data to determine the  size  of  the  geographic  region
       needed.  If the block size is unknown, run the command _m_._e_x_a_m_i_n_e_._t_a_p_e .


       The user can run this  program  either  non-interactively  or  interac-
       tively.   The  program will be run non-interactively if the user speci-
       fies program arguments on the command line, using the form:


       mm..ddeemm..eexxttrraacctt iinnppuutt==_n_a_m_e [[oouuttppuutt==_n_a_m_e] [[bblloocckkssiizzee==_v_a_l_u_e]  [[ssttaarrtt==_v_a_l_u_e]
       [[eenndd==_v_a_l_u_e]



       Alternately,  the  user  can  simply  type mm..ddeemm..eexxttrraacctt on the command
       line, without program arguments.   In  this  case,  the  user  will  be
       prompted for needed parameter values using the standard GRASS interface
       described in the manual entry for _p_a_r_s_e_r .



   PPaarraammeetteerrss::
       iinnppuutt==_n_a_m_e
              The full path name of tape device or file from  which  DEM  data
              are to be extracted.
              Default:  /dev/rmt0

       oouuttppuutt==_n_a_m_e
              The name to be assigned to the output file containing raster DEM
              data extracted from 1/2-inch tape.

       bblloocckkssiizzee==_v_a_l_u_e
              The physical block size (record length) of each each record,  in
              bytes.  _m_._e_x_a_m_i_n_e_._t_a_p_e
               can be used to determine block size.

       ssttaarrtt==_v_a_l_u_e
              First DEM quad to look at (default 1).

       eenndd==_v_a_l_u_e
              Last DEM quad to look at (default 9999999).

       The  user  should  check  the  boundaries and resolution of the current
       region  setting  (see  _g_._r_e_g_i_o_n  )  BBEEFFOORREE   extracting   data,   since
       _m_._d_e_m_._e_x_t_r_a_c_t will only extract the data that falls within these bound-
       aries and only use the set resolution during extraction.


       WWaarrnniinngg:  This program assumes that the tape has OONNLLYY DEM data.  If the
       tape  contains other files (DLG, for example) the program will not skip
       over them.  In this case, forward the tape to the first DEM file.   Use
       the appropriate UNIX commands (mmtt to forward the tapes past the non-DEM
       files, and dddd to extract and copy the correct files)  on  the  tape  on
       another machine first to extract the non-DEM data from the tape.


       UUSSGGSS  TTaappeess:   This version of _m_._d_e_m_._e_x_t_r_a_c_t is sensitive to formatting
       errors.  If the format on a tape is wrong, the program exits  with  the
       error  message:  "The  file with incorrect data format encountered ..."
       Nevertheless, the program continues.  In this  case,  run  the  program
       without  specifying  input  files.  If the program exits again with the
       same error message, there is an inconsistency in the data format.


       The format error:  Each USGS Dem file consists of A and  B,  and  some-
       times C, records--
       type A record  header
       type  B  record  collection  of profiles with various numbers of eleva-
       tions
       type C record  accuracy


       This new version of _m_._d_e_m_._e_x_t_r_a_c_t cannot skip over any records  to  the
       end  of a DEM file. It first determines how many records there are in a
       file, reads those records, and then proceeds to the header  (record  A)
       of  the  next  file.  Thus it is very important for the program to know
       whether or not there is a C record to be read at the end of each  file.
       This  information  is given in the  file's header record (type A) which
       has a field set to 1 when a C-record exits, and to 0  when  a  C-record
       does not exist.


       In  some  DEM  files,  the accuracy field is set to 0, even though a C-
       record does exist.  Because of this error, when the  program  tries  to
       read  the  data,  it  will  not  try  to read the C-record, but instead
       attempts to go on to the next  file  and  read  its  header--a  type  A
       record.   This  results  in the format error because type A records and
       type C records have different formats, and the  program  is  trying  to
       read a type A record  when  the tape is presenting a type C record.


       When  this  format  error in a file is encountered, forward the tape to
       the next file.
