       The GRASS program _d_._d_i_s_p_l_a_y is used to display maps on a graphics moni-
       tor  and  prepare  final map products for printing.  It is advisable to
       first run _d_._e_r_a_s_e before each run of _d_._d_i_s_p_l_a_y to  prepare  the  screen
       for graphics.


       After  invoking the command dd..ddiissppllaayy, the DISPLAY MAIN MENU appears on
       the monitor.  Options  in  this  and  subsequent  _d_._d_i_s_p_l_a_y  menus  are
       selected  through  use  of  the pointing device (mouse). When the mouse
       cursor is over the desired menu selection, the user simply presses  any
       button on the mouse.


       _d_._d_i_s_p_l_a_y  is  a  macro  that allows the user to access a wide range of
       GRASS display functions in a menu-driven and highly  interactive  envi-
       ronment.   Most  of the functions accessible through _d_._d_i_s_p_l_a_y can also
       be run independently of one another by running the GRASS  display  (_d_.)
       commands listed in the SEE ALSO section, below. However, in many cases,
       these other _d_. commands give the  user  greater  flexibility  and  make
       available  more options than are available through the _d_._d_i_s_p_l_a_y menus.
       For example, the _d_._d_i_s_p_l_a_y _l_a_b_e_l file option runs the  _d_._l_a_b_e_l  command
       using  defaults.  Users  running _d_._l_a_b_e_l directly from the command line
       have the choice of stipulating specific label background and text  col-
       ors,  as  well  as  text sizes and font types.  Users running the _l_a_b_e_l
       file option through _d_._d_i_s_p_l_a_y cannot specify  these  options;  instead,
       default values are used (see _d_._l_a_b_e_l for default values used).


       The  _d_._d_i_s_p_l_a_y tool is best learned by playing with its options.  Refer
       to the individual _d_. and other commands in the SEE ALSO section  for  a
       detailed examination of these functions.

       The  user  can also modify the current region settings from the DISPLAY
       MAIN MENU.  Using the mouse, the user can choose to _z_o_o_m in on  a  por-
       tion  of  the displayed raster map layer to create a smaller geographic
       region.  Once the user has defined the corners of this area  using  the
       mouse,  the  smaller  area is enlarged and replotted on the screen. The
       user can similarly choose to _z_o_o_m out. In this case, the user uses  the
       mouse to encompass that portion of the reduced map that the user wishes
       to make the current geographic region and display in the center of  the
       screen.  The  larger  map is then replotted and displayed. Finally, the
       user can enter geographic coordinates for the region's corners from the
       keyboard  using  the  GRASS command _g_._r_e_g_i_o_n. This is done by selecting
       the _t_y_p_e coordinates option.


       The main menu also offers the user the option of hiding the  main  menu
       for ten seconds (_h_i_d_e _m_e_n_u _f_o_r _1_0 _s_e_c_o_n_d_s).


       The  _d_._d_i_s_p_l_a_y  command must be run in conjunction with a program which
       converts the GRASS graphics commands  generated  by  _d_._d_i_s_p_l_a_y  to  the
       graphics commands that the current device understands. This device will
       almost always be a graphics  monitor.  On  most  systems  the  user  is
       required  to start up this other program separately from (and prior to)
       _d_._d_i_s_p_l_a_y.  In such cases, a locally-defined  program,  usually  "moni-
       tor",  is  used  (see  your  GRASS  manager). (For example, on MASSCOMP
       machines, the _d_._m_o_n program must be running in the  foreground  on  the
       graphics  monitor.   On  SUN machines, the _d_._m_o_n program can be started
       from any terminal and run in the background.)


       _d_._d_i_s_p_l_a_y sends program output to the current graphics frame  (set,  by
       default, to the full graphics screen unless modified by the user).  You
       can use _d_._f_r_a_m_e to create and choose a smaller  display  frame  on  the
       graphics monitor for use by _d_._d_i_s_p_l_a_y.


       See  the  GRASS  macro  _3_d_._v_i_e_w_._s_h stored under $GISBASE/scripts for an
       example of how you can create a  _d_._d_i_s_p_l_a_y-like  macro  using  a  shell
       script.
