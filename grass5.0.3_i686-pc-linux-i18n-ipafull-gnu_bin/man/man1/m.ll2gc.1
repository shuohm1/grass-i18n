       _m_._l_l_2_g_c returns geocentric coordinates for geographic coordinates (lat-
       itude and longitude).  Geographic coordinates are in degrees,  minutes,
       and  seconds  and  must include designation of north or south {_n|_s} and
       east or west {_e|_w}.  The spheroid on which they are based must also  be
       entered.  The height (in meters) above the spheroid is optional.


       The  list  of spheroids available is somewhat dynamic.  It may not con-
       tain exactly the ones listed below.  To determine the current  list  of
       possible spheroids, type in: mm..llll22ggcc llaatt==_0_n lloonn==_0_w ss==_h_e_l_p

       A  list  of  available spheroids will be printed on the screen.  If the
       spheroid desired is not on the list, the values for the semi-major axis
       and  the  eccentricity squared for the spheroid may be entered in place
       of   a   spheroid   name   in   the   following    format:    ss==aa==_s_e_m_i_-

       The  distances  designated  by  "x," "y" and "z" are in meters from the
       center of the earth. Because the sample point is on the equator and  is
       at  90  degrees  west, two of the three parameters have a value of zero
       (i.e., the point is at the origin of those two dimensions).

       For a brief discussion of spheroids see _m_._l_l_2_u.


       Geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude) describe the location of  a
       point  on  the  earth relative to the equator in the north/south direc-
       tions and relative to Greenwich in the east/west directions.  The  same
       point will have different coordinates depending on the spheroid used as
       the approximation of the shape of the earth.   The  geocentric  coordi-
       nates  given here describe the point on the basis of the same spheroid,
       but they use the center of the spheroid as their origin.  This  can  be
       thought  of  as  being  the  center of the earth, which is why they are
       called "geocentric."  Describing the location of a point in a  spheroid
       requires  three  points:  x, y, and z;  these are measured out from the
       center along three different axes.  The distances given are in  meters.


       This  is  an  experimental  program.   It is part of initial efforts to
       incorporate geographic coordinates into GRASS.
