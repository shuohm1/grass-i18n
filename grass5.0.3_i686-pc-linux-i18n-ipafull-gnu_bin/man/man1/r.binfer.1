       _r_._b_i_n_f_e_r is an expert system shell containing an inference engine based
       on  Bayesian  statistics  (reasoning  from  past  experience).   It  is
       designed to assist human experts in a field develop computerized expert
       systems for land use planning and management. These expert systems  are
       designed to aid non-experts make decisions about land use.


       In  Bayesian expert system programs like _r_._b_i_n_f_e_r, the system bases the
       probable impacts of a future land use action on the conditional  proba-
       bilities about the impact of similar past actions.

       Using appropriate _r_._b_i_n_f_e_r syntax, the human expert structures an input
       knowledge/control script with an appropriate combination of  map  layer
       category values (GRASS raster map layers that contain data on soil tex-
       ture, slope, density, etc.) and attributes relevant to  decision-making
       (e.g.,  rainfall,  temperature,  season,  subjective  judgement, etc.).
       Options exist for specifying a user interface and a data base  contain-
       ing prior and conditional probabilities necessary to infer the value of
       a goal attribute.  The expert also specifies the format for display  of
       end  results  (raster  map layers) in the input script.  New raster map
       layers -- one for each possible inferred attribute value -- are created
       that  contain the probability of the inferred attribute value occurring
       in each grid cell.


       Alternately, a single new map layer called _r_._b_i_n_f_e_r (or whatever _o_u_t_p_u_t
       name  is  specified  by  the user) is also output.  This map shows, for
       each grid cell, the inferred attribute value that has the highest prob-
       ability  of  occurring in each grid cell, given the values of the _i_n_p_u_t
       raster map layer and contextual attributes.


       _r_._b_i_n_f_e_r scripts are typed into a file  by  the  user  using  a  system
       editor  like  _v_i, and then input to _r_._b_i_n_f_e_r as the _i_n_p_u_t file named on
       the command line.  For a complete description of the _i_n_p_u_t syntax,  see
       the  document  GRASS  Tutorial:  r.binfer  (forthcoming).   For example
       _r_._b_i_n_f_e_r scripts see the EXAMPLES section below.  The results are  used
       to generate the new raster map layers in the user's current mapset.


       As  stated above, _r_._b_i_n_f_e_r scripts contain descriptions of two types of
       input attributes. The map layer type attributes are actual GRASS raster
       map  layers,  with  the  values  defined to be ranges of the categories
       within that raster map layer.  For example, if the user  chooses  slope
       as  one  of  the  layer  attributes,  the possible values for the slope
       attribute might be the following:
       flat         (slopes between 0 and 5 degrees)
       low          (slopes between 6 and 10 degrees)
       medium       (slopes between 11 and 30 degrees)
       steep        (slopes greater than 31 degrees)

       The contextual attributes are those that do not  represent  raster  map
       layers,  but rather, information that reflects criteria relevant to the
       specific decision being contemplated.  For example, if the user chooses
       "rainfall  amount" as one of the contextual attributes, possible values
       assigned to the "rainfall amount" attribute might be the following:
       low          (rainfall amounts less than an inch)
       medium       (rainfall amounts between one and three inches)
       high         (rainfall amounts grater than three inches)

       The inferred attribute values are specified along with a  prior  proba-
       bility and a table of conditional probabilities that indicate the prob-
       ability of that inferred attribute value occurring given that an  input
       attribute value has occurred.


       _r_._b_i_n_f_e_r will determine the value of contextual attributes by prompting
       the user for input. It will then open each of  the  raster  map  layers
       corresponding to each map layer attribute. _r_._b_i_n_f_e_r then determines the
       values for all map layer attributes in each grid cell.  Using the  con-
       ditional  probability tables, the prior probabilities, and Bayes' theo-
       rem, _r_._b_i_n_f_e_r calculates the output  probabilities  for  each  inferred
       value  and  writes  its  probability of occurrence as a percentage.  It
       also determines which value is most likely to occur in  that  cell  and
       writes that to the _o_u_t_p_u_t file name.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
       The  two sample scripts shown below illustrate only the use of _r_._b_i_n_f_e_r
       to:

              estimate the probability that an avalanche will occur, and

              infer the probability of finding pine mountain beetles,

       at each cell across a landscape, given the input map  layer  attributes
       shown below.  The author makes no claims as to the correctness of using
       these criteria to infer either event.


       Some Notes on Script Construction.

               No Data ( or what to do with category zero).


       If category zero is excluded from the ranges  of  any  layer  attribute
       value,  it  is  treated  as "no data" and the resulting probability and
       combined maps will reflect this.


       Otherwise, category zero is treated just like any other cell value.

               Category ranges for layer attributes.


       The category ranges are specified using _r_._r_e_c_l_a_s_s rules.  For  example,
       a value list for slope might look like this:
       (flat [0 1 thru 3], gentle [4 thru 8],
       moderate [9 thru 15], other [16 thru 89]).


               Question Attachments.


       Question  attachments  can  be  supplied  for  and context attribute or
       attribute value. If names are chosen cleverly, the default menu  should
       be sufficient.

               Determinant  List.  At this time the determinant list serves no
              real purpose.  Planned extensions to binfer  will  make  use  of
              this list, so just don't use it for now.

               Probabilities.   The  conditional  probability  table  is  very
              important, try to be sure of its accuracy.
