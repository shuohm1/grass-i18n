       _n_v_i_z organizes several useful tools for combining and visualizing GRASS
       raster, vector and site files.  In particular, _n_v_i_z provides a detailed
       user interface with several panels used for specifying various options.
       The  user  may  specify  arbitrary  combinations of raster maps, vector
       maps, and site maps.  The attributes associated with each map (such  as
       color, masking, line width, etc.) may be modified independently.  Also,
       cut-planes may be used to display an interpolated cross  section  of  a
       set  of  raster  maps.   _n_v_i_z emphasizes a flexible and natural viewing
       mechanism allowing the user to modify view parameters  such  as  camera
       position,  surface  exaggeration,  display resolution, lighting models,
       and light position.  Lastly, _n_v_i_z supports an animation  and  scripting
       mechanism  for building visualizations of sequences of GRASS data.  The
       scripting mechanism may be used to record and playback  any  user  ses-
       sion.   Other  miscellaneous  features include: a facility for querying
       map displays for information, and image processing  tools  which  allow
       the placement of labels and scales on the display.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       The  initial  set  of  files used by _n_v_i_z may be specified by providing
       file arguments for elevation, vector and sites.  If the user  specifies
       program  arguments on the command line, the program will start with the
       given set of files.  Alternatively, the user can simply  type  _n_v_i_z  on
       the command line and the program will ask for parameter values and flag
       settings interactively, using the standard GRASS parser interface.

PPAANNEELLSS
       _n_v_i_z features are presented to the user using "panels".  A panel encap-
       sulates  some  functionality  and  provides  an  interface for users to
       access this functionality.  For example, _n_v_i_z is distributed with  pan-
       els  for manipulating surfaces, vector files, light sources, and so on.
       In addition to these default panels, _n_v_i_z may  also  be  configured  to
       load application specific panels.


       In addition to the default panels, _n_v_i_z can be instructed to load addi-
       tional panels by either using the path option (see above) or by setting
       the  GRASS  resource  NvizPanelPath to the appropriate list of directo-
       ries.  Any directory specified as a path directory must contain a  pan-
       elIndex  file  which  names  the panels stored in that directory. Panel
       creation and panelIndex files are described elsewhere.

       NvizPanelPath
              Specifies a list of  directories  containing  additional  panels
              (see PANELS).

       NvizAutoSurfColors
              If  set  to  true then any surface loaded from the surface panel
              will have the color attribute set to the  map  used  to  specify
              topology.  This is the default behavior.


NNOOTTEESS
       Currently,  _n_v_i_z  must be invoked from within GRASS (preferably version
       5.x).  That is, start GRASS then invoke _n_v_i_z from the GRASS shell.


       _n_v_i_z is built on top of the Tcl/Tk environment.  Be sure  you  have  at
       least  Tcl  8.0 or later and Tk 8.0 or later and that appropriate envi-
       ronment variables are set correctly.
