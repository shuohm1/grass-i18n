EEXXPPLLAANNAATTIIOONN
       The "Site Occurrence Report" provides aggregate site information  orga-
       nized by raster map layers.


       The report header contains the following information:

       LLooccaattiioonn
              GRASS database location (e.g., yakima),

       MMaappsseett GRASS mapset (e.g., sample)

       AAnnaallyyssiiss RReeggiioonn
              the  rectangular  area in which the analysis was run, reflecting
              the current geographic settings of the user's mapset.

       SSiittee LLiisstt
              name and description of the site list used for  the  report  and
              the  number  of  sites in the list.  See manual entry for _s_._m_e_n_u
              for more discussion about these site lists.

       The rest of the report is divided into reports for each raster map lay-
       ers  specified  by the user.  In this SAMPLE OUTPUT, only one map layer
       (arch_survey) was specified.


       Certain information heads up each of these reports:

       llaayyeerr  identifies the raster map layer along with the map layer  TITLE.

       cceellllss iinn aannaallyyssiiss rreeggiioonn
              the size of the analysis region (in cells).

       ssiitteess iinn aannaallyyssiiss rreeggiioonn
              the number of sites in the analysis region.

       For  each  map layer category which occurs in a cell falling within the
       boundaries of the analysis region, as well as totals for the map  layer
       as a whole, various statistics are presented:

       SSiittee CChhaarraacctteerriissttiiccss
              These  are  the numbers (i.e., values) and names (i.e., descrip-
              tions) for each category (i.e., characteristic) which occurs  in
              the map layer.

       cceellllss ccoovveerr
              the  number  of cells in the analysis region having the category
              value (i.e., site characteristic).

       %% ccoovveerr
              the predominance of the category within the analysis region.

       eexxppeecctteedd ssiitteess
              the number of sites  in  the  analysis  region  which  would  be
              expected  to  be observed having the category value if all sites
              were evenly distributed by in the region.

       aaccttuuaall ssiitteess
              the number of sites in the analysis region which  were  occurred
              in cells having the category value.

       cchhii ssqquuaarree
              gives  the  user  a  statistical test of the hypothesis that For
              this hypothesis to be true, the chi-square test must fail  since
              we  are  calculating  expected sites according to the hypothesis
              that

       ddeeggrreeeess ooff ffrreeeeddoomm
              Number of degrees of freedom for the chi-square test.  Each cat-
              egory  value  will  have  1 degree of freedom, and can be tested
              alone.  The entire map layer will have 1 less degree of  freedom
              than the number of categories.


NNOOTTEE
       Category zero (0) throughout GRASS represents "no data".  Therefore, it
       is reported, but not included in the totals or in  the  computation  of
       the chi-square statistics.
