       _i_._t_a_p_e_._t_m_3  is a successor to _i_._t_a_p_e_._t_m.  _i_._t_a_p_e_._t_m_3 can import Landsat
       Thematic Mapper imagery in fast format, full scene, and quadrant  scene
       formats.  Imports may be done from 1600 BPI and 6250 BPI 9-track tapes,
       QIC 150 tape, 8mm tape, or from disk files.  _i_._t_a_p_e_._t_m_3  is  completely
       command-line  driven,  although  the  usual GRASS parser may be used if
       command line options are not given.  During the import, the program may
       also prompt for filenames to use and tapes to be mounted.


       _i_._t_a_p_e_._t_m_3  must  be  run  in  a location with an x,y coordinate system
       (i.e., a coordinate system with a projection 0.)  Refer to the  imagery
       manual entry.

              The prefix with which to name the  raster  maps  for  each  band
              imported.   The  band  number  of each raster map is appended to
              this prefix.  If omitted, the group name is used as the  prefix.

              The  list  of  bands  to import.  Band numbers range from 1 to 7
              inclusive.  Band numbers may be specified  in  any  order.   For
              fast format imagery, a band number of "P" may be used to specify
              the panchromatic band.

       _i_._t_a_p_e_._t_m_3  can import Landsat TM imagery in three formats: full scene,
       quadrant scene, and fast format.  Full scene and  quadrant  scene  file
       formats  are very similar, and differ only in the size of the image.  A
       quadrant scene corresponds to one quarter of a full scene of  the  same
       area.  _i_._t_a_p_e_._t_m_3 can read fast format imagery in its A and B versions.
       See the references for file format documents.


       Information about a TM scene can be obtained by using  the  _-_e  option.
       It  is useful to use this option before importing imagery.  This option
       will examine the files on tape or disk and print important  information
       about the scene.  Fields printed include the file format, size of image
       in pixels, scene ID, and date of creation.  Coordinates for  the  scene
       center  or  corners  are  given depending on the file format.  For full
       scene and quarter scene formats, the  _-_e  option  requires  the  volume
       directory  file  and a leader and imagery file from a single band.  For
       the fast format, the _-_e option requires only a header file.


       _i_._t_a_p_e_._t_m_3 allows the block size to be specified.  This is  the  number
       of  bytes  to  read from a tape at a time.  The block size is optional;
       specifying it may or may not make the import run faster.   The  default
       is  32768.   Look  on  the  tape's  label  to find the block size.  For
       QIC-150 tapes, the block size must be a multiple of 512 or  the  import
       will  fail.   The  maximum allowable block size is one megabyte (1024 *
       1024 = 1048576 bytes.)  The block size is not used when importing  from
       disk files.


       The following sections describe the tape file formats and how to import
       from disk files.  If you are copying imagery between tapes or to  disk,
       it  is  necessary  to  understand how the files are arranged on tape so
       that _i_._t_a_p_e_._t_m_3 will be able to import from copied tapes correctly.  If
       you  are  importing from the original tapes or exact copies there is no
       need to be concerned with the tape formats.

       For full scene and quadrant scene formats, it may require more than one
       tape  to  store  the seven bands of a single Landsat scene.  The set of
       tapes containing imagery for a single scene is  called  a  volume  set.
       Each  tape in a set has the same format.  The first file on the tape is
       a volume directory file.  This is followed by a  leader  file,  imagery
       file, and trailer file for each band on the tape.  There may be supple-
       mental files after the the bands, but these are not used by _i_._t_a_p_e_._t_m_3.
       For  example,  a  tape containing bands 1-3 of Landsat imagery contains
       these files:
              Volume Directory File
              Band 1 Leader File
              Band 1 Imagery File
              Band 1 Trailer File
              Band 2 Leader File
              Band 2 Imagery File
              Band 2 Trailer File
              Band 3 Leader File
              Band 3 Imagery File
              Band 3 Trailer File
              Supplemental File

       When importing from tape, the program will prompt  the  user  to  mount
       each  tape  needed.  Tapes may be mounted in any order.  Only the tapes
       that contain the bands to be imported need be mounted.   Be  sure  that
       tapes are rewound or positioned correctly before mounting them.

       _i_._t_a_p_e_._t_m_3  can  import  imagery from disk files.  The volume directory
       must be copied from tape to disk, as well as the leader,  imagery,  and
       trailer  files for each band to import.  To speed the import, the file-
       names should all have the same prefix and have a .ls# suffix,  where  #
       is an integer that increases sequentially from zero.  The prefix may be
       any name.  For example, if you wanted to import bands  2  and  3  of  a
       quadrant  scene from disk files, you would copy the files from tape and
       give them names like this:
              Volume Directory File       landsat.ls0
              Band 2 Leader File          landsat.ls1
              Band 2 Imagery File         landsat.ls2
              Band 2 Trailer File         landsat.ls3
              Band 3 Leader File          landsat.ls4
              Band 3 Imagery File         landsat.ls5
              Band 3 Trailer File         landsat.ls6

       The volume directory file must have the .ls0 suffix.  Only the  leader,
       imagery,  and trailer files for the bands to be imported need be copied
       to disk.  The prefix "landsat" is used here, but any name can be  used.
       Each  file  must  have a .ls# suffix, though.  By naming the files this
       way, _i_._t_a_p_e_._t_m_3 can easily read the files in the correct  order.   Once
       these files are on disk, they may be imported with a command like this:


       _i_._t_a_p_e_._t_m_3 _i_n_p_u_t_=_l_a_n_d_s_a_t _g_r_o_u_p_=_l_a_n_d_s_a_t _b_a_n_d_s_=_1_,_2_,_3


       The input option specifies the prefix to use for the file  names.   The
       .ls#  suffix  should  not  be included in the input option.  _i_._t_a_p_e_._t_m_3
       will automatically append the .ls# suffix to each file in turn.


       Naming the imagery files in this fashion is the easiest way  to  import
       from  disk.   However,  _i_._t_a_p_e_._t_m_3  can import from files that have any
       names.  The program will prompt for filenames.  Enter the filenames  at
       each prompt in the order that the files would be read from tape in.  To
       import this way, omit the input option in the command, like this:


       _i_._t_a_p_e_._t_m_3 _g_r_o_u_p_=_l_a_n_d_s_a_t _b_a_n_d_s_=_1_,_2_,_3


       If you are importing from disk files with  .ls#  filenames,  _i_._t_a_p_e_._t_m_3
       will  prompt  for  a  filename at any time that it cannot find the next
       file to read.

       Like full scenes and quadrant scenes, imagery in fast format  may  come
       on multiple tapes, depending on the amount of data.  The file format is
       very simple, consisting of a header file followed by imagery files  for
       each of the bands.  The imagery files are flat data files; they have no
       header information within them.  For example, a set of seven bands  for
       a  scene  in  fast format may come on three 9-track tapes and look like
       this:
              Tape 1         Tape 2Tape 3
              Header File    Header FileHeader File
              Band 1         Band 4Band 7
              Band 2         Band 5
              Band 3         Band 6

       Because the band files have no header information in them, the only way
       _i_._t_a_p_e_._t_m_3  can tell which band is which is by the order the files come
       in their header file.  If fast format imagery is ever copied  to  other
       tapes be sure the files are kept in the same order as they came.


       To  import  fast format imagery from disk files, copy the files to disk
       using the same naming convention used for  quadrant  and  full  scenes.
       The  header  file  must have a .ls0 extension.  The band 1 imagery file
       should have a .ls1 extension, band 2  a  .ls2  extension,  etc.   If  a
       panchromatic band is available, give it a .ls8 extension, for lack of a
       better name.


       If you are importing only spectral bands, the header file from any tape
       may  be  used  as the .ls0 file.  But if you are importing the panchro-
       matic band, use the header file from its tape.   The  headers  for  the
       spectral bands and the panchromatic band are different; be sure to copy
       the right one to the .ls0 file before importing.


       When importing the panchromatic band from fast format imagery,  specify
       the band number as "P", like this:


       _i_._t_a_p_e_._t_m_3 _i_n_p_u_t_=_l_a_n_d_s_a_t _g_r_o_u_p_=_l_a_n_d_s_a_t _b_a_n_d_s_=_P


       If  the input option is omitted, of if the program cannot find the file
       for a band asked for, it will prompt for a filename to be entered.

       _i_._t_a_p_e_._t_m_3 can extract an entire image or a rectangular  region  within
       an  image.  Use the rows and cols options to specify the ranges of rows
       and columns to import.  Before importing the imagery, use the _-_e option
       to display the number of rows and columns in the image.  Row and column
       numbers begin at 1.  Row numbers increase from top  (north)  to  bottom
       (south).  Column numbers increase from left (west) to right (east).  If
       either option is omitted the full range is used.  The  program  ignores
       the  current geographic region when importing.  When the import is com-
       plete, the current region is set to the region extracted.

NNOOTTEESS
       Raster files created will overwrite exiting files with the  same  names
       without warning.


       Use  the dd(1) command to copy files to tapes.  When copying to 9-track
       and 8mm tapes, just use the if and of options with a  large  blocksize.
       Use  caution when copying data to QIC-150 tapes.  QIC-150 tapes require
       all files to use record lengths that are multiples of 512.  Files whose
       lengths  are not multiples of 512 must be padded.  Always use dddd with
       the "sync" option when copying files to QIC-150 tape, like this:
                 dd if=filename of=/dev/rst0 obs=32768 conv=sync

       obs is the output block size; use any multiple of 512.  The larger  the
       block size the faster the copy will be done. When Landsat imagery files
       are copied this way they will be padded at the end, making them  longer
       than  they  originally  were.   _i_._t_a_p_e_._t_m_3 will have no problem reading
       padded files, but other programs may.
