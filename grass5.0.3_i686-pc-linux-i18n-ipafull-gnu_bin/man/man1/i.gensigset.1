       _i_._g_e_n_s_i_g_s_e_t is a  non-interactive  method  for  generating  input  into
       _i_._s_m_a_p_.   It is used as the first pass in the a two-pass classification
       process.  It reads a raster map layer, called the training  map,  which
       has some of the pixels or regions already classified.  _i_._g_e_n_s_i_g_s_e_t will
       then extract spectral signatures from an image based on the classifica-
       tion of the pixels in the training map and make these signatures avail-
       able to _i_._s_m_a_p_.


       The user would then execute the GRASS  program  _i_._s_m_a_p  to  create  the
       final classified map.

              ground truth training map


       This  raster layer, supplied as input by the user, has some of its pix-
       els already classified, and the rest  (probably  most)  of  the  pixels
       unclassified.  Classified means that the pixel has a non-zero value and
       unclassified means that the pixel has a zero value.


       This map must be prepared by the user in advance.  The  user  must  use
       _r_._d_i_g_i_t,  a  combination  of  _v_._d_i_g_i_t  and  _v_._t_o_._r_a_s_t,  or  some  other
       import/developement process (e.g., _v_._i_n_._t_r_a_n_s_e_c_t_s_) to define the  areas
       representative of the classes in the image.


       At  present,  there  is no fully-interactive tool specifically designed
       for producing this layer.

       ggrroouupp==_n_a_m_e
              imagery group


       This is the name of the group that contains the band files  which  com-
       prise  the  image  to  be analyzed. The _i_._g_r_o_u_p command is used to con-
       struct groups of raster layers which comprise an image.



       ssuubbggrroouupp==_n_a_m_e
              subgroup containing image files


       This names the subgroup within the group that selects a subset  of  the
       bands  to be analyzed. The _i_._g_r_o_u_p command is also used to prepare this
       subgroup.  The subgroup mechanism allows the user to select a subset of
       all the band files that form an image.

       ssiiggnnaattuurreeffiillee==_n_a_m_e
              resultant signature file


       This  is the resultant signature file (containing the means and covari-
       ance matrices) for each class in the training map  that  is  associated
       with the band files in the subgroup selected.



       mmaaxxssiigg==_v_a_l_u_e
              maximum number of sub-signatures in any class
              default: 10


       The  spectral signatures which are produced by this program are "mixed"
       signatures (see NOTES).  Each signature contains one or more  subsigna-
       tures  (represeting  subclasses).  The algorithm in this program starts
       with a maximum number of subclasses and reduces this number to a  mini-
       mal  number  of subclasses which are spectrally distinct.  The user has
       the option to set this starting value with this option.

       If none of the arguments are specified on the command line, _i_._g_e_n_s_i_g_s_e_t
       will interactively prompt for the names of these maps and files.


       It  should  be  noted that interactive mode here only means interactive
       prompting for maps and files.  It does not mean  visualization  of  the
       signatures that result from the process.

       The  algorithm  in  _i_._g_e_n_s_i_g_s_e_t determines the parameters of a spectral
       class model known as a Gaussian mixture distribution.   The  parameters
       are  estimated  using multispectral image data and a training map which
       labels the class of a subset of the image pixels.   The  mixture  class
       parameters are stored as a class signature which can be used for subse-
       quent segmentation (i.e., classification) of the multispectral image.


       The Gaussian mixture class is a useful model because it can be used  to
       describe  the  behavior  of  an information class which contains pixels
       with a variety of distinct spectral characteristics.  For example, for-
       est, grasslands or urban areas are examples of information classes that
       a user may wish to separate in an image.  However, each of these infor-
       mation  classes  may  contain  subclasses each with its own distinctive
       spectral characteristic.  For example, a forest may contain  a  variety
       of different tree species each with its own spectral behavior.


       The objective of mixture classes is to improve segmentation performance
       by modeling each information class as a probabilistic  mixture  with  a
       variety  of  subclasses.  The mixture class model also removes the need
       to perform an initial unsupervised segmentation  for  the  purposes  of
       identifying  these  subclasses.   However, if misclassified samples are
       used in the training process, these erroneous samples may be grouped as
       a separate undesired subclass.  Therefore, care should be taken to pro-
       vided accurate training data.


       This clustering algorithm estimates both the number  of  distinct  sub-
       classes  in  each  class, and the spectral mean and covariance for each
       subclass.  The number of subclasses is estimated using Rissanen's mini-
       mum  description  length (MDL) criteria [1].  This criteria attempts to
       determine the number of subclasses which "best" describe the data.  The
       approximate  maximum likelihood estimates of the mean and covariance of
       the subclasses are computed using  the  expectation  maximization  (EM)
       algorithm [3].
