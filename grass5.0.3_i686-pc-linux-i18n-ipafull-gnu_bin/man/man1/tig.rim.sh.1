       _t_i_g_._r_i_m_._s_h is a shell script which queries information from a rim  data
       base  using  the  GRASS command _v_._d_b_._r_i_m, which is an interface between
       GRASS and RIM.  The _d_b_n_a_m_e given on the command line should be the name
       of  a  rim  data base created using _v_._i_n_._t_i_g_e_r.  _t_i_g_._r_i_m_._s_h will create
       several new vector files.  Three of these are: a county outline map,  a
       map  of  tract  boundaries  within  the county, and a map showing block
       group boundaries.  For every tract number  given  on  the  input  line,
       additional  vector  maps  will be created showing: the tract outline, a
       block group boundary map for each block group within the tract,  and  a
       map  showing  block  boundaries  within each block group.  Output files
       will be named _d_b_n_a_m_e_._c_o_u_n_t_y, _d_b_n_a_m_e_._t_r_a_c_t and  _d_b_n_a_m_e_._b_g  for  the  map
       layers  showing  the  county  outline,  the  tract  outlines within the
       county, and the block group boundaries within the county.   The  vector
       file  showing  the  boundary  for  an  individual  tract  will be named
       _T_t_r_a_c_t_N, where _t_r_a_c_t_N is the tract number given on  the  command  line.
       The vector files created to show an individual block group boundary and
       block boundaries within that block group will be named using the appro-
       priate  tract  number  and block group number as part of the name, with
       suffixes of .bg and .bk respectively.

       This command must be installed separately as part  of  the  package  of
       routines  dealing  with the import of Census (TIGER) data.  It requires
       the use of _r_i_m and _v_._d_b_._r_i_m, which must be compiled first.


       You must include at least one tract number on the command line for this
       command to function.  Use _t_i_g_e_r_._i_n_f_o_._s_h to obtain all tract numbers for
       a given TIGER type1 data file.


       If the master binary vector file created using _v_._i_n_._t_i_g_e_r  is  modified
       after  it  is  in  GRASS, this program will probably not work.  In that
       situation, the processes from this shell script may simply  be  run  by
       hand,  using  _v_._d_b_._r_i_m  directly,  but searching the old vector file to
       find lines for the new vector files without  using  the  binary  offset
       field (vectoff).


       Vector files showing the block boundaries within a block group may con-
       tain hydrology lines, which in fact define the edge of a census  block.
