       _i_._t_a_p_e_._o_t_h_e_r is a generic program that extracts imagery from tape using
       the tape description that is input by the user.


       This program must be run in a LOCATION_NAME with a x,y coordinate  sys-
       tem  (i.e., a coordinate system with projection 0).  For further infor-
       mation regarding this LOCATION_NAME  refer  to  the  manual  entry  for
       _i_m_a_g_e_r_y.


       The  first  prompt  in  _i_._t_a_p_e_._o_t_h_e_r  asks the user for the tape device
       name.  This is sometimes  /dev/rmt0 (for a density of 1600),  but  this
       varies with each machine.


       The next prompt is:
       Please mount and load tape, then hit RETURN

              If there are files at the beginning of the tape  which  are  not
              image  data,  they  can  be  skipped. Sometimes information that
              comes with a tape will indicate the number of  header  files  or
              records on the tape.  The GRASS utility _m_._e_x_a_m_i_n_e_._t_a_p_e will also
              provide this information.  The _r_e_c_o_r_d _l_e_n_g_t_h is  the  number  of
              columns  in the image, while the _n_u_m_b_e_r _o_f _r_e_c_o_r_d_s is the number
              of rows in the image (not always correct, see _b_l_o_c_k_i_n_g _f_a_c_t_o_r _o_f
              _d_a_t_a  _i_n  _t_h_e _f_i_l_e below). NHAP imagery and usually most scanned
              aerial imagery do not have tape header files, but this should be
              checked.   TM  imagery has one header file that contains imagery
              format of data files and parameters of  data  aquisition.   SPOT
              imagery  has two files that should be skipped on the first tape,
              and one file to be skipped on the second  tape  (of  a  two-tape
              set).

       _n_u_m_b_e_r _o_f _r_e_c_o_r_d_s _i_n _t_h_e _r_e_m_a_i_n_i_n_g _f_i_l_e_s _t_o _b_e _s_k_i_p_p_e_d
              If  the files which contain the image begin with non-image data,
              these records can also be skipped.  This is usually 0  for  most
              data types. SPOT imagery stored in 1600bpi has one header record
              in the image file on each tape that should be skipped.

              Most aerial imagery have 3 bands, but satellite  simulator  data
              may have more.  TM data has seven bands and SPOT has three bands
              as a standard, respectively. The total number of  bands  on  the
              tape  should be specified here, not just the number that will be
              extracted.

       _d_a_t_a _f_o_r_m_a_t
              The two formats that imagery data are most  commonly  stored  in
              are  called  _b_a_n_d  _i_n_t_e_r_l_e_a_v_e_d  format (BIL) and _b_a_n_d _s_e_q_u_e_n_t_i_a_l
              format (BSQ).  In BIL format, each record on the  tape  contains
              one  line  for  one  band  of  data.  If the data contains three
              bands, then the first five records will look like this:
              band 1, line 1
              band 2, line 1
              band 3, line 1
              band 1, line 2
              band 2, line 2

              In BSQ format, all lines of one band are stored  together  on  a
              tape,  followed  by  all  lines of another band, followed by all
              lines of the next band, etc.  These data are stored as  if  they
              were in a one band BIL format:
              band 1, line 1
              band 1, line 2
              band 1, line 3
                   .
                   .
                   .
              band 2, line 1
              band 2, line 2
                   .
                   .
              band 2, line 156
              band 2, line 157

              Each  pixel  contains one byte and there is one line per record.
              BSQ format is the format that  is  usually  created  by  optical
              scanning  devices  when  they  scan  photographs,  but  not  all
              digitized aerial imagery are stored in this format.  The  format
              of  the  data  is  usually  written on the exterior of the tape;
              this should be checked.

       _l_e_n_g_t_h _(_i_n _b_y_t_e_s_) _o_f _t_h_e _l_o_n_g_e_s_t _r_e_c_o_r_d _o_n _t_h_e _t_a_p_e
              This must be set to the number of  bytes  in  the  longest  data
              record.   It  is used to determine how large a buffer to use for
              reading the tape. This  value  can  be  obtained  using  _m_._e_x_a_m_-
              _i_n_e_._t_a_p_e_.

              This  is  the number of lines combining into one physical record
              on tape.  It is usually one for most  of  imageries,  i.e.,  one
              line  per  physical  record.   However, considering on data com-
              pressing and tape memory saving, sometimes more than  one  lines
              are  combined into one physical record on the tape.  This number
              may be written on the exterior of the tape, otherwise  the  user
              need to experiment on this number by running of _i_._t_a_p_e_._o_t_h_e_r.

       The user is asked to enter the prefix/group for the (raster) band files
       to  be  created.   This name will precede each band file extracted into
       GRASS.  For example, if three bands are extracted the  following  three
       band files will result:


       _p_r_e_f_i_x_n_a_m_e_._1
       _p_r_e_f_i_x_n_a_m_e_._2
       _p_r_e_f_i_x_n_a_m_e_._3


       The  specified  _p_r_e_f_i_x_n_a_m_e  will also automatically become the name for
       the imagery group file being created.  Each image (i.e.,  each  run  of
       _i_._t_a_p_e_._o_t_h_e_r) should be given a unique prefix/group name.

       Finally,  the starting row, ending row, starting column and ending col-
       umn are required. This allows the user to extract  any  subset  of  the
       image from the tape.
                             EXTRACT
       please select desired tape window (geographic region
       definition) to extract
                          start row:_0_
                            end row:_0_

                          start col:_0_

       AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT <ESC> TO CONTINUE
                     (OR <Ctrl-C> TO CANCEL)

       The extraction process will begin by first skipping the number of spec-
       ified files, advancing to the starting row, and then reading the  tape.
       The percent completion of the extraction is displayed on the screen.


       Following  the  extraction,  the extracted band files will be listed as
       raster map layers available in the current MAPSET.   These  raster  map
       layers  may  be  displayed individually using the GRASS commands _d_._d_i_s_-
       _p_l_a_y, _d_._r_a_s_t or _i_._p_o_i_n_t_s.

NNOOTTEESS
       This program can be used for extraction of TM, SPOT and other types  of
       data  from tape;  however, the user must supply information to the pro-
       gram on how the image data is laid out on the tape.  For  example,  the
       image  data  may  be padded with surrounding extra rows and/or columns;
       the user may wish to skip over these rows and columns and extract  only
       the  actual image data from the tape.  _i_._t_a_p_e_._o_t_h_e_r does not know where
       image data actually begins on the tape;  the user must tell the program
       what  portion  of  the tape data to extract.  Often, information on the
       orientation and layout of the image data on tape will be included on  a
       printout  accompanying  any  tape  data received by the user;  however,
       this may not always be the case.  The user may need to experiment  with
       various runs of _i_._t_a_p_e_._o_t_h_e_r before extracting the portions of an image
       actually desired.


       After extracting an image from tape, the geographic region in  the  x,y
       coordinate LOCATION_NAME will be set, based upon the extracted rows and
       columns from the tape. The relationship  between  the  image  rows  and
       columns  and the coordiates bounding the geographic region is discussed
       in the _i_m_a_g_e_r_y manual entry.


       This program is interactive and requires no command line arguments.

RROOWW AANNDD CCOOLLUUMMNN EEXXTTRRAACCTTIIOONN
       The display options in GRASS allow the user to locate rows and  columns
       on  the  digital image.  If enough disk space is available, one band of
       an entire image, or one band of a portion of an image known to  contain
       the area of interest, can be extracted and displayed.  The _m_e_a_s_u_r_e_m_e_n_t_s
       option in _d_._d_i_s_p_l_a_y, or _d_._w_h_e_r_e (following a run of _d_._r_a_s_t) will echo x
       and y coordinates to the screen.  (These coordinates will display nega-
       tive numbers in the north-south direction  but  ignoring  the  negative
       sign  will yield the row number.  See the _i_m_a_g_e_r_y manual entry for fur-
       ther explanation.)


       If a photograph of the digital image is available, the rows and columns
       to  be  extracted  can be determined from it by associating inches with
       the total number of known rows and columns in the scene.  For  example,
       if the total length of the photograph is 12 inches, the total number of
       rows on the tape is 2000, and the  northwest  corner  of  the  area  of
       interest begins 2 inches from the top of the photo, then:
               12" / 2000 rows = 2" / x rows
               x = 333.333

       The  northwest  corner  of the area of interest starts at row 333.  The
       starting row, ending row, starting column, and  ending  column  can  be
       calculated in this manner.
