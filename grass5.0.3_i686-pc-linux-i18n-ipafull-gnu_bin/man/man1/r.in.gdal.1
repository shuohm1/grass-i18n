       _r_._i_n_._g_d_a_l allows a user to create a (binary) GRASS raster map layer, or
       imagery group, from any GDAL supported  raster  file  format,  with  an
       optional  title.  The imported file may also be optionally used to cre-
       ate a new location.

       If GDAL doesn't support the indicated file it will  report  it  with  a
       message like ERROR 4: `abc.e00' not recognised as a supported file for-
       mat by GDAL, or that the format wasn't built into the version of  libg-
       dal.1.1.so being used.


       rr..iinn..ggddaall  will  only  operate  correctly if the GDAL shared library is
       installed on the system and accessable (normally via  LD_LIBRARY_PATH).
       If  not,  r.in.gdal  will  report Unable to initialize GDAL bridge.  If
       this occurs it means that you either don't  have  GDAL  installed  (ie.
       libgdal.1.1.so),  it  isn't  in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH, or it is the wrong
       version.    Recent   builds   of   libgdal   may   be   available    at
       http://gdal.velocet.ca/projects/grass, and the shared library should be
       copied into $GISBASE/lib.  Binary distributions of GRASS will  normally
       include libgdal.

        r.in.gdal uses a number of strategies to find the GDAL shared library.
       It first looks in $GISBASE/lib/.  Then  it  looks  for  $GDAL_HOME  and
       finally  it  searches  without  a  path  letting  all the standard Unix
       dlopen() search rules apply (which normally includes  LD_LIBRARY_PATH).

LLooccaattiioonn CCrreeaattiioonn
       rr..iinn..ggddaall  attempts  to  preserve projection information when importing
       datasets if the source format includes projection information,  and  if
       the  GDAL  driver supports it.  If the projection of the source dataset
       does not match the projection of the current  location  rr..iinn..ggddaall  will
       report an error message (Projection of dataset does not appear to match
       current location) and then  report  the  PROJ_INFO  parameters  of  the
       source dataset.


       If  the user wishes to ignore the difference between the apparent coor-
       dinate system of the source data and the  current  location,  they  may
       pass the --oo flag to override the projection check.


       If  the user wishes to import the data with the full projection defini-
       tion, it is possible to have r.in.gdal automatically create a new loca-
       tion  based on the projection and extents of the file being read.  This
       is accomplished by passing the name to be used for the new location via
       the llooccaattiioonn parameter.  Upon completion of the command, a new location
       will have been created (with only a PERMANENT mapset), and  the  raster
       will  have been imported with the indicated oouuttppuutt name into the PERMA-
       NENT mapset.


       Support for GCPs: In case the image contains GCPs they are written to a
       POINTS  file  within  an  imagery  group. They can directly be used for
       i.rectify. The _t_a_r_g_e_t option allows  to  automatically  re-project  the
       GCPs  from  their  own projection into another projection read from the
       PROJ_INFO file of the location name _t_a_r_g_e_t.

NNOOTTEESS
       I plan to make a variety of improvements to  rr..iinn..ggddaall  in  the  future
       including support for reporting everything known about a dataset if the
       oouuttppuutt parameter is not set.


       The rr..iinn..ggddaall comand does support the following features,  as  long  as
       the underlying format driver supports it:



        Color Table
              Bands  with  associated  colortables  will have the color tables
              transferred.  Note that if the source has no colormap, r.in.gdal
              in  GRASS  5.0  will  emit  no  colormap.   Use r.colors map=...
              color=grey to assign a greyscale colormap.  In a future  version
              of GRASS r.in.gdal will likely be upgraded to automatically emit
              greyscale colormaps.

        Data Types
              Most GDAL data types are supported.  Float32  and  Float64  type
              bands are translated as GRASS floating point cells (but not dou-
              ble precision ...  this could be  added  if  needed),  and  most
              other  types  are  translated  as  GRASS  integer  cells.   This
              includes 16bit integer data sources.  Complex (some  SAR  signal
              data  formats)  data  bands are translated to two floating point
              cell layers (*.real and *.imaginary).


        Georeferencing
              If the dataset has affine georeferencing information, this  will
              be  used  to  set  the north, south, east and west edges.  Rota-
              tional coefficients will  be  ignored,  resulting  in  incorrect
              positioning for rotated datasets.


        Projection
              The  datasets  projection will be used to compare to the current
              location or to define a new location.   Internally  GDAL  repre-
              sents  projections  in  OpenGIS Well Known Text format.  A large
              subset of the total set of GRASS projections are supported.


        Null Values
              Raster bands for which a null value is recognised by  GDAL  will
              have  the  null pixels transformed into GRASS style nulls during
              import.  Many generic formats (and formats poorly  supported  by
              GDAL) do not have a way of recognising null pixels in which case
              r.null should be used after the import.


        GCPs  Datasets that have Ground Control Points will have them imported
              as  a  POINTS  file associated with the imagery group.  Datasets
              with only one band that would otherwise have been translated  as
              a  simple  raster map will also have an associated imagery group
              if there are ground control points.  The  coordinate  system  of
              the  ground control points is reported by r.in.gdal but not pre-
              served.  It is up to the user to ensure that the location estab-
              lished  with  i.target has a compatible coordinate system before
              using the points with i.rectify.
