       This  program  creates a GRASS vector map in the current mapset (UTM or
       Lat-Long locations only) with labelled line segments  constructed  from
       the  end  points  (nodes)  from the Type 1 TIGER file records and shape
       points from the Type 2 TIGER file.  The  nodes  and  shape  points  are
       matched  by  the  TIGER  record  number (TLID field).  In the attribute
       (label) file which is built (in the _d_i_g___a_t_t directory), the  lines  are
       given  the  "area boundary" type and line labels are the record numbers
       (9 digits!).


       The Type 1 file may contain the records for a complete county, a subset
       for  a  county,  or  those from more than one county concatenated.  The
       Type 2 file must contain all those records corresponding to the Type  1
       records,  but  may contain extra records which will not be used.  Typi-
       cally, a subset of Type 1 records is used and a full county Type 2 file
       is used.


       The program should function well independent of the termination charac-
       ter(s) at the end of each line in the input files.  , ,  neither,  one,
       or  both  are acceptable.  Different distribution media apparently have
       different record delimiting characters.


       The -p flag should not normally be used.   It  causes  the  program  to
       build a disk file pointer table for all of the Type 2 records each time
       the program runs, rather than using the table built previously.  Detec-
       tion, naming and verification of the pointer file are automatic.  It is
       created in the "tmp" space in the user's location.

       The file specified by the _t_l_i_d parameter may be of any size.  Any  num-
       ber  at the beginning of a line will be interpreted to be the TLID of a
       Type 1 record which is to be included in the output map.  Other  infor-
       mation  on these lines is ignored, as are lines which do not begin with
       a number.  If fewer than 5000 numbers are in this file, it is only read
       once  and execution speed is greatly enhanced.  Normally, a full Type 1
       file will be specified by the _t_1 parameter when a _t_l_i_d file is used.

       CCaauuttiioonn:: This program will overwrite an existing vector map of the same
       name without warning.


       The  Type  2 input file must be on a device capable of "seeking," i.e.,
       not a tape drive. CD-ROM is OK (but program will run much  faster  from
       disk files).


       Input lines in a _t_l_i_d file are limited to 300 characters in length.  If
       the system can allocate space to store all the TLID numbers  read  from
       this  file,  it  is  only  read  once  and  execution  speed is greatly
       enhanced; on a typical system, space for more than 10,000  numbers  can
       be allocated.
