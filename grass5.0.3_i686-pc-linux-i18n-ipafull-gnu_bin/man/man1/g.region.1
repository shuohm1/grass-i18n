       The _g_._r_e_g_i_o_n program allows the user to manage the settings of the cur-
       rent geographic region.  These regional boundaries can be  set  by  the
       user  directly  and/or  set from a region definition file (stored under
       the windows directory in the user's current mapset).  The user can cre-
       ate, modify, and store as many geographic region definitions as desired
       for any given mapset.  However, only one  of  these  geographic  region
       definitions  will  be  current  at  any  given  moment, for a specified
       mapset;  i.e., GRASS programs that respect the geographic  region  set-
       tings will use the current geographic region settings.

       RReeggiioonn::
              Here,  a  _r_e_g_i_o_n  refers  to a geographic area with some defined
              boundaries, based on a specific map coordinate  system  and  map
              projection.   Each  region  also has associated with it the spe-
              cific east-west and  north-south  resolutions  of  its  smallest
              units (rectangular units called "cells").


       The  region's  boundaries  are given as the northernmost, southernmost,
       easternmost, and westernmost points that define its extent.  The  north
       and  south boundaries are commonly called _n_o_r_t_h_i_n_g_s, while the east and
       west boundaries are called _e_a_s_t_i_n_g_s.


       The region's cell resolution defines the size of the smallest piece  of
       data  recognized (imported, analyzed, displayed, stored, etc.) by GRASS
       programs affected by the current region settings.  The north-south  and
       east-west  cell  resolutions  need  not be the same, thus allowing non-
       square data cells to exist.

       DDeeffaauulltt RReeggiioonn::
              Each GRASS LOCATION_NAME has a fixed geographic  region,  called
              the  default  geographic  region  (stored  in  the  region  file
              DEFAULT_WIND under the special mapset PERMANENT),  that  defines
              the  extent  of  the  data base.  While this provides a starting
              point for defining new  geographic  regions,  user-defined  geo-
              graphic regions need not fall within this geographic region.

       CCuurrrreenntt RReeggiioonn::
              Each  mapset  has  a  current  geographic  region.   This region
              defines the geographic area in  which  all  GRASS  displays  and
              analyses will be done.  Data will be resampled, if necessary, to
              meet the cell resolutions of the current geographic region  set-
              ting.

       RReeggiioonn DDaattaa BBaassee::
              Each  GRASS  MAPSET  may  contain any number of pre-defined, and
              named, geographic regions.  These region definitions are  stored
              in  the  user's current mapset location under the windows direc-
              tory (also referred to as the user's data base of region defini-
              tions).   Any  of  these  pre-defined  geographic regions may be
              selected, by name, to  become  the  current  geographic  region.
              Users  may  also  access  saved  region definitions stored under
              other mapsets in the current  location,  if  these  mapsets  are
              included in the user's mapset search path.

       Most  of the options will require the user to edit a geographic region,
       be it the current geographic region or one stored in  the  user's  data
       base  of region definitions (the windows directory).  A standard prompt
       is used to perform this edit.  An example is shown below:

              Modify the current geographic region directly Allows the user to
              edit the current region.

              Set  current  geographic  region  from default region Copies the
              default region to the current geographic region, and  then  lets
              the user edit the current geographic region.

              Set current geographic region from a data base geographic region
              Allows the user to select a geographic region by name  from  the
              data base of geographic regions to become the current geographic
              region, and then lets  the  user  edit  the  current  geographic
              region.


       Note:   geographic  region  definition files may be selected from other
       mapsets as well, if accessible and in the user's mapset search path.

              Set current geographic region from a  raster  (cell)  map  layer
              Allows  the  user  to select a raster map layer, copies the cell
              header for this map layer to the current geographic region,  and
              then  lets  the  user  edit the current geographic region.  This
              option is useful when subsequent GRASS operations will  be  used
              to  produce  a  raster map layer from one input raster map layer
              and it is necessary that the  result  coincide  with  the  input
              raster map layer.

              Save  the  current  geographic  region (window) in the data base
              Allows the user to save the current geographic  region  settings
              in  the  user's  data  base  of  such settings.  These files are
              stored in the windows directory under the user's current mapset.
              This  option is useful when the current geographic region is set
              directly using option 2, or even by another GRASS program (e.g.,
              _d_._d_i_s_p_l_a_y).   This  option  installs an otherwise temporary geo-
              graphic region setting into  the  geographic  region  definition
              data base for recall when needed.

              Create  a  new data base geographic region setting Creates a new
              geographic region definition in the user's  data  base  of  such
              settings  in  the  windows  directory  under the current mapset,
              using the geographic region edit prompt described above.   After
              the  geographic  region definition is created, the user is asked
              if this geographic region setting should also  be  used  as  the
              current geographic region.

              Modify  a  data  base  geographic region setting Modifies a geo-
              graphic region setting (in the data base of such settings in the
              windows  directory  of the current mapset), using the geographic
              region edit prompt.  After the changes have been made, the  user
              is  asked  if this geographic region setting should also be used
              as the current geographic region.

       Alternately, the user can modify the settings of the current geographic
       region  by  specifying  all needed parameters on the command line.  The
       user enters the command  gg..rreeggiioonn _p_a_r_m_s, where _p_a_r_m_s are the  following
       parameters and/or flags:

   FFllaaggss::
       --aa     Align  the  region  to  the resolution supplied by the user. The
              default is to align the region resolution to  match  the  region
              boundaries.

       --dd     Set current region settings equal to default region settings.

       --gg     Print the current region settings (shell script style) in a for-
              mat that can be given back to _g_._r_e_g_i_o_n on its command line.

       --pp     Print the current region settings.

       --ll     Print the current region settings in lat/long coordinates.

       --cc     Print the current region map center coordinates.

       --mm     Print the region resolution in meters (from geodesic).  With  no
              other  flags  the default output format is shell stype (-g). The
              region resolution represents the center of the map. The  resolu-
              tions  are calculated at the four outside edges, then the two NS
              edges are averaged and  the  two  EW  edges  are  averaged,  the
              results finally printed.

       --uu     Do not update the current region file settings.  Allows the user
              to temporarily use a different region  setting,  without  saving
              this setting.

       ww==_v_a_l_u_e
              Set map coordinate value for the region's western edge to _v_a_l_u_e

       rreess==_v_a_l_u_e
              Set grid resolution (both north-south and east-west) to _v_a_l_u_e

       nnssrreess==_v_a_l_u_e

       eewwrreess==_v_a_l_u_e
              Set east-west grid resolution value to _v_a_l_u_e

       zzoooomm==_n_a_m_e
              Set current region settings to the smallest region  encompassing
              all non-zero data in the named raster map layer that fall inside
              the user's current region.


       If the user also includes the rraasstteerr==_n_a_m_e option on the  command  line,
       zzoooomm==_n_a_m_e  will  set the current region settings to the smallest region
       encompassing all non-zero data in the named zzoooomm map that  fall  inside
       the region stated in the cell header for the named rraasstteerr map.

       aalliiggnn==_n_a_m_e
              Set  the  current  resolution  equal to that of the named raster
              map, and align the current region to a row and  column  edge  in
              the  named  map.  Alignment only moves the existing region edges
              outward to the edges of the  next  nearest  cell  in  the  named
              raster map -- not to the named map's edges.  To perform the lat-
              ter function, use the rraasstteerr==_n_a_m_e option.

              will reset the northing and easting for the current region,  but
              leave the south edge, west edge, and the region cell resolutions
              unchanged.



       gg..rreeggiioonn  --ddpp ss==_6_9_8_0_0_0
              will set the current region from  the  default  region  for  the
              GRASS  data  base  location, reset the south edge to 698000, and
              then print the result.

              The n=_v_a_l_u_e may also be specified as a function of  its  current
              value:   n=n+_v_a_l_u_e  increases  the  current northing, while n=n-
              _v_a_l_u_e decreases it.  This is also true for s=_v_a_l_u_e, e=_v_a_l_u_e, and
              w=_v_a_l_u_e.  In this example the current region's northern boundary
              is extended by 1000  units  and  the  current  region's  western
              boundary is decreased by 500 units.

              This form allows the user to set the region boundary values rel-
              ative to one another.  Here, the northern boundary coordinate is
              set  equal  to  1000  units  larger than the southern boundary's
              coordinate value, and the eastern boundary's coordinate value is
              set  equal  to  1000  units  larger  than the western boundary's
              coordinate value.  The corresponding forms s=n-_v_a_l_u_e and


       w=e-_v_a_l_u_e may be used to set the values of the  region's  southern  and
       western  boundaries, relative to the northern and eastern boundary val-
       ues.

              This form will make the current region settings exactly the same
              as  those given in the cell header file for the raster map layer
              _s_o_i_l_s.

              This form will first look up the cell header file for the raster
              map  layer  _s_o_i_l_s,  use  this as the current region setting, and
              then shrink the region down to the smallest region  which  still
              encompasses all non-zero data in the map layer _s_o_i_l_s.  Note that
              if the parameter _r_a_s_t_e_r_=_s_o_i_l_s were not specified, the zoom would
              move to encompass all non-zero data values in the soils map that
              were located within the current region setting.



       gg..rreeggiioonn --uupp rraasstteerr==_s_o_i_l_s
              The --uu option suppresses the re-setting of  the  current  region
              definition.   This  can  be  useful  when  it is desired to only
              extract region information.  In this case, the cell header  file
              for  the soils map layer is printed without changing the current
              region settings.



       gg..rreeggiioonn --uu rraasstteerr==_s_o_i_l_s zzoooomm==_s_o_i_l_s ssaavvee==_s_o_i_l_s
              This will zoom into the smallest region  which  encompasses  all
              non-zero  soils data values, and save the new region settings in
              a file to be called _s_o_i_l_s and stored under the windows directory
              in  the  user's current mapset.  The current region settings are
              not changed.



       gg..rreeggiioonn  --pp
              This will print the current region in the format:

              Note that the resolution  is  reported  in  meters  not  decimal
              degrees.



       gg..rreeggiioonn  --gg
              The --gg option prints the region in the following format:
              n=4294050.00
              s=4249950.00
              e=526050.00

              ewres=100.00


       gg..rreeggiioonn  --ll
              The --ll option prints the region in the following format:
              long: -103.86815 lat: 44.49980 (north/west corner)
              long: -103.62896 lat: 44.49718 (north/east corner)

              Center latitude:  44:26:02.724974N [44.43409]

              This  format  does not have the rows and columns, but can be fed
              back into _g_._r_e_g_i_o_n on its command line.

       The --pp (or --gg) option is recognized last.  This means that all  changes
       are applied to the region settings before printing occurs.

NNOOTTEE
       After  all updates have been applied, the current region's southern and
       western boundaries are (silently) adjusted so that the north/south dis-
       tance  is  a  multiple  of  the  north/south  resolution  and  that the
       east/west distance is a multiple of the east/west resolution.


       With the --aa flag all four boundaries are adjusted to be even  multiples
       of the resolution.


       The --mm flag will report the region resolution in meters. The resolution
       is calculated by averaging the resolution  at  the  region  boundaries.
       This  resolution  is  calculated  by  dividing the geodesic distance in
       meters at the boundary by the number of rows or columns.   For  example
       the east / west resolution (ewres) is determined from an average of the
       geodesic distances at the North and South  boundaries  divided  by  the
       number of columns.
