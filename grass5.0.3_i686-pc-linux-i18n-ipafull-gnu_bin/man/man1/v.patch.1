       _v_._p_a_t_c_h allows the user to combine any  number  of  vector  map  layers
       together to create one composite vector map layer.

   PPaarraammeetteerrss::
       iinnppuutt==_n_a_m_e,_n_a_m_e, ...
              Name(s) of input vector map(s) to be patched together.

       oouuttppuutt==_n_a_m_e
              Name assigned to composite "patched" vector output map.



       The  program  will  be  run non-interactively if the user specifies the
       names of the vector map(s) to be patched and the name of an output file
       to  store  the  resulting  composite  patched vector map on the command
       line, in the form: vv..ppaattcchh iinnppuutt==_n_a_m_e[,_n_a_m_e,...]  oouuttppuutt==_n_a_m_e



       Alternately, if the user runs _v_._p_a_t_c_h without specifying input and out-
       put file names on the command line (by typing simply vv..ppaattcchh), the pro-
       gram will prompt the user for inputs using the standard GRASS interface
       described in the manual entry for _p_a_r_s_e_r.

NNOOTTEESS
       The  vector  map layers to be patched together must exist in the user's
       current mapset search path, and the composite  vector  map  layer  name
       given must not already exist in the user's current mapset.


       After  running  _v_._p_a_t_c_h,  the header file will contain only information
       taken  from  the  first  _i_n_p_u_t  file   name   given   in   the   string
       iinnppuutt==_n_a_m_e_,_n_a_m_e_,  _._._.,  with  the  exception of the geographic region's
       edge information, and the scale and threshold information.  (The user's
       current  geographic  region  settings  are ignored; this information is
       instead extracted from the vector file headers.) In the  new  composite
       vector  map  layer,  the  boundaries  of  the geographic region will be
       expanded to encompass all of the geographic area included  in  the  map
       layers  being  patched, and the scale will be set equal to the smallest
       (i.e., most gross) scale used by any of the patched  map  layers  (this
       will  affect  default  node-snapping thresholds).  The map threshold is
       calculated automatically from the map scales given in the file headers,
       and (currently) is not used directly.  The composite vector map layer's
       header will probably need to be edited; this can be  done  from  within
       the GRASS program _v_._d_i_g_i_t.


       The  GRASS  programs  _v_._m_k_g_r_i_d and _v_._m_k_q_u_a_d_s can be used to ensure that
       the borders of the maps to be patched together align neatly.


       Any vectors that are duplicated among the maps being  patched  together
       (e.g., border lines) will have to be edited or removed after _v_._p_a_t_c_h is
       run.  Such editing can be done using _v_._d_i_g_i_t.


       After running _v_._p_a_t_c_h the user must run _v_._s_u_p_p_o_r_t on the composite vec-
       tor map layer in order to create a dig_plus (topology) file for it.  At
       this time, you can request that a  _v_e_r_y  small  snapping  threshold  be
       used, to cause the nodes that match up across vector map layers to snap
       together without affecting the integrity of the remainder of the vector
       map layer.

BBUUGGSS
       The  dig_cats  and  reg  file  information  for  the maps being patched
       together is not copied to the composite, patched map layer.   The  user
       should therefore run _v_._s_u_p_p_o_r_t on the output file produced by this pro-
       gram.
