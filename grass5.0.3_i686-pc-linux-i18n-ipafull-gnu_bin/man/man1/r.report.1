       _r_._r_e_p_o_r_t allows the user to set up a series of report parameters to  be
       applied  to  a raster map layer, and creates a report.  If invoked with
       command line arguments, the report will print out to the  screen  only.
       However,  output  may  be redirected to a file or another program using
       the UNIX redirection mechanism. If invoked without command  line  argu-
       ments,  the user is given the option of printing out each report and/or
       saving output to a file.


       The program will be run non-interactively, if the  user  specifies  the
       names of raster map layers and any desired options on the command line,
       using   the    form    rr..rreeppoorrtt    [--hhmmffqqeezznnNNCCii]    mmaapp==_n_a_m_e[,_n_a_m_e,...]
       [uunniittss==_n_a_m_e[,_n_a_m_e,...]] [ppll==_v_a_l_u_e] [ppww==_v_a_l_u_e] [oouuttppuutt==_n_a_m_e]

       where  each  map  _n_a_m_e  is  the  name of a raster map layer on which to
       report, each unit _n_a_m_e is a unit of measure in which results are to  be
       reported,  the  pl  _v_a_l_u_e gives the page length, the pw _v_a_l_u_e gives the
       page width, and the (optional) flags --hh, --ee, --mm, --ff, --qq,  --zz,  --nn,  --NN,
       --CC, and --ii have the meanings stated below.

   FFllaaggss::
       --hh     Suppress the print-out of page headers.

       --mm     Report on zero values, because a mask is being used.

       --ff     Use formfeeds between pages when printing report output.

       --qq     Run  quietly, without printing program messages to standard out-
              put.

       --ee     Use scientific format for the numbers that are too long  to  fit
              in the tab table field if their decimal form is used.

       --zz     Report  only  non-zero  data  values.  Zero  data  will  not  be
              reported. However, for multiple map layers this  means  that  if
              zero values occur in every map layer, they will not be reported;
              if non-zero category values occur in any map layer  (along  with
              zeros in others), the non-zero values along with the zero values
              will be reported.

       --nn     Filter out all no data cells.

       --NN     Filter out cells where all maps have no data.

       --CC     Report for cats fp ranges (fp maps only).

       --ii     Read fp map as integer (use map's quant rules).


   PPaarraammeetteerrss::
       mmaapp==_n_a_m_e_,_n_a_m_e_,_._._.
              Names of raster map(s) on which to report.

       uunniittss==_n_a_m_e
              Units of measure in which results  are  to  be  reported.  These
              units  are  based  on  the number of cells in the user's _a_r_e_a of
              interest (i.e., cells within the current geographic region defi-
              nition,  and  the  current mask [if any]). These are established
              with the programs _r_._m_a_s_k, respectively.  Options: Possible units
              of  measurement  are:  mmii  (cover  measured  in square _m_i_l_e_s) mmee
              (cover measured in square _m_e_t_e_r_s) kk (cover  measured  in  square
              _k_i_l_o_m_e_t_e_r_s)  aa  (cover  measured  in _a_c_r_e_s) hh (cover measured in
              _h_e_c_t_a_r_e_s) cc (the number of _c_e_l_l_s in the area of interest) pp (the
              _p_e_r_c_e_n_t _c_o_v_e_r, excluding no data areas)

       ppll==_v_a_l_u_e
              Page length, in lines, in which report will be output.  Default:
              0 (lines)

       ppww==_v_a_l_u_e
              Page width, in characters,  in  which  report  will  be  output.
              Default: 79 (characters)

       oouuttppuutt==_n_a_m_e
              The name of a file to store the report in. If not specified, the
              report is printed on the terminal screen.

       nnuullll==_s_t_r_i_n_g
              String representing no data cell value.

       nnsstteeppss==_v_a_l_u_e
              Number of fp subranges to collect stats from.



       Alternately, the user can simply type _r_._r_e_p_o_r_t  on  the  command  line,
       without  program arguments. In this case, the user will be prompted for
       program flag settings and parameter values.


       The report itself consists of two parts, a header section and the  main
       body of the report.


       The header section of the report identifies the raster map layer(s) (by
       map layer name and TITLE),  location,  mapset,  report  date,  and  the
       region of interest. The area of interest is described in two parts: the
       user's current geographic region is presented, and  the  mask  is  pre-
       sented (if any is used).


       The  main body of the report consists of from one to three tables which
       present the statistics for each category and the totals for  each  unit
       column.


       Note  that, unlike _r_._s_t_a_t_s, _r_._r_e_p_o_r_t allows the user to select the spe-
       cific units of measure in which statistics will be reported.


       Following is the result of a _r_._r_e_p_o_r_t run on the raster map layer _g_e_o_l_-
       _o_g_y  (located  in  the  Spearfish, SD sample data base), with the units
       expressed in square miles and acres. Here, _r_._r_e_p_o_r_t output is  directed
       into the file _r_e_p_o_r_t_._f_i_l_e.

       If  the user runs _r_._r_e_p_o_r_t interactively and saves the report output in
       a file, this file will be placed into the user's current working direc-
       tory.


       If the user runs _r_._r_e_p_o_r_t non-interactively, report output can be saved
       by redirecting it to a file or a printer  using  the  UNIX  redirection
       mechanism.
