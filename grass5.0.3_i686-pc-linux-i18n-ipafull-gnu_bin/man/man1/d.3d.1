       _d_._3_d  displays  three-dimensional  graphic images based on GRASS raster
       map layers.  The user identifies the viewing point, the line of  sight,
       a  vertical exaggeration factor, the viewing angle (field of view), the
       frequency and color of vector grid lines to appear in the display,  the
       map to be displayed in 3-d, and the map whose category values are to be
       used as elevation values in the 3-dimensional image.


       The program will be run non-interactively if  the  user  specifies  all
       needed  parameter  values and flag settings on the command line. Alter-
       nately, the user can simply type dd..33dd on  the  command  line;  in  this
       case,  the  program  will prompt the user for parameter values and flag
       settings using the standard interface described in the manual entry for
       _p_a_r_s_e_r.


       Three-dimensional images can also be generated through the GRASS _d_._d_i_s_-
       _p_l_a_y program.

       --aa     Each grid-cell is rendered using four elevation coordinates: one
              for  each corner. By default, each corner takes the value of the
              grid-cell to the lower right. With the -a option each corner  is
              calculated to be an average of the four bordering cell elevation
              values.

       --nn     Show null elevations.


   PPaarraammeetteerrss::
       mmaapp==_n_a_m_e
              The raster map layer used to generate the color shown in the 3-d
              output  (i.e.,  the  map whose x and y values will be displayed,
              using the z values present in the _e_l_e_v_a_t_i_o_n map layer.)

       eelleevvaattiioonn==_n_a_m_e
              The raster map used to generate the texture  in  the  3-d  image
              (i.e.,  the  map whose category values will become the elevation
              values in the 3-d map displayed). This need not be an  elevation
              map layer, although elevation is commonly used.
              Default: elevation

       ffrroomm__ccoooorrddiinnaattee==_x_,_y_,_z
              Coordinates  of  the  viewing  point,  given  as: _n_o_r_t_h_i_n_g_,_e_a_s_t_-
              _i_n_g_,_e_l_e_v_a_t_i_o_n.  The default _f_r_o_m___c_o_o_r_d_i_n_a_t_e value is appropriate
              for the spearfish sample data set.
              Default:  Calculated  at  run-time just south-west of the south-
              west corner.

       ttoo__ccoooorrddiinnaattee==_x_,_y_,_z
              Coordinates of center of view, given as: _n_o_r_t_h_i_n_g_,_e_a_s_t_i_n_g_,_e_l_e_v_a_-
              _t_i_o_n.   The  default  _t_o___c_o_o_r_d_i_n_a_t_e value is appropriate for the
              spearfish sample data set.
              Default: Calculated at run-time as the center of the image

       eexxaaggggeerraattiioonn==value
              Vertical exaggeration factor. This value is  multiplied  by  the
              "elevation" values (category values) in the _e_l_e_v_a_t_i_o_n map layer.
              As the vertical coordinates are exaggerated, the  elevation  (z)
              value  of  the  center  of  view  (the  _t_o___c_o_o_r_d_i_n_a_t_e) should be
              increased.
              Default: 2.0

       lliinneess==_v_a_l_u_e
              North-south and east-west trending lines can be drawn on the 3-d
              image output, to enhance the 3-d effect.  The _l_i_n_e_s value speci-
              fies the number of rows and columns to skip  between  lines.   0
              means  "display  no  lines".  Lines  will  be drawn in the _c_o_l_o_r
              stated.  The user can elect to only display these lines, without
              displaying the _m_a_p, by setting the -l flag.
              Default: 1

       ffiieelldd==_v_a_l_u_e
              The  field  of  view  (viewing  angle)  in  the image, stated in
              degrees.
              Default: 30

       ccoolloorr==_n_a_m_e
              Color of vector _l_i_n_e_s drawn on the output.
              Options: color, white, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo,
              violet, gray, black
              Default: gray

       bbooxx==_n_a_m_e
              Color of bounding box
              Options:             red,orange,yellow,green,blue,indigo,violet,
              white,black,gray,brown,magenta,aqua,grey,none
              Default: none



       The resulting three-dimensional image is drawn in the active  frame  on
       the  graphics monitor. The user should select and erase the full graph-
       ics monitor frame before running _d_._3_d to prepare the screen for  graph-
       ics.   Refer to the GRASS program _3_d_._v_i_e_w_._s_h for a demonstration of the
       _d_._3_d program.

       The interactive mode prompts for the raster map  to  be  rendered,  the
       raster  map  to be queried for elevation information, and an optionally
       saved set of saved viewing parameters. The user is then presented  with
       a form in which the options can be modified.


       It  is  suggested  that  the following procedure be used to efficiently
       find the correct viewing  parameters.  Start  with  a  gross  grid  (by
       default,  a  resolution is chosen which limits the total number of rows
       and columns), display lines only, set line  colors  to  "color"  (lines
       take  their  color  from the map), set the box color to something other
       than "none", and use the default viewing coordinates.  Experiment  with
       the  viewing  coordinates  until  the map is positioned in a desireable
       configuration. When the map is lined up correctly, set the display res-
       olution as low as you like for a final image.

BBUUGGSS
       Several  additions  to  this program have been suggested. These include
       the following:

               Border the image with a visually appealing curtain.

               Add x,y,z coordinates and scale information  to  the  displayed
              3-d image.

               Provide a graphic-oriented user interface for identifying view-
              ing parameters.

               Display output more quickly by doing mathematics in integers.

               Add the option of plotting vector map layers.
