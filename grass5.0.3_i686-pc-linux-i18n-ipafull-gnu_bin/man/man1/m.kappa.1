       _m_._k_a_p_p_a tabulates the error matrix of classification result by  reading
       error  matrix.   Both  overall  kappa (accompanied by its variance) and
       conditional kappa values are calculated.


       The user can run the program non-interactively by specifying all needed
       flag settings and parameter values on the command line, in the form:


       _m_._k_a_p_p_a _[_-_h_] _[_i_n_p_u_t_n_a_m_e_] _[_o_u_t_p_u_t_n_a_m_e_] _[_t_i_t_l_e_"_n_a_m_e_"_]

              Name  of  error matrix file.  If file name is not specified, the
              program will obtain error matrix from standard input.   If  file
              name  is  provided, it must have the following format: the first
              line is an integer N which is the number of rows/columns of  the
              matrix;  the  remainder  of  the  file is the error matrix, or N
              lines, each containing N integers. For example:
                                         tab(  ); lnnnnnn nnnnnnn.  6 28010  0

              Name  of ascii file in which to report results.  If no file name
              is provided, the report will go to standard output.

              Title of the report file which is the first line in output file.
              Default: Error matrix and Kappa



       Alternately,  the  user  can run _m_._k_a_p_p_a interactively by simply typing
       _m_._k_a_p_p_a without command line arguments; in this case, the user will  be
       prompted  for the names of input error matrix.  _m_._k_a_p_p_a then calculates
       the kappa  values  for  overall  and  each  classes  along  with  their
       variances.   Also  percentage  of commission and ommission error, total
       correct in counts, total area in counts and percentage of overall  cor-
       rect counts are tabulated.


       The  report  will  be displayed on screen, or written to an output file
       which is in plain text format and named by user at  prompt  of  running
       the program.
