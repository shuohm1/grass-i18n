       This program imports a TIFF raster file (8 or 24 bit) to  GRASS  raster
       file(s).  Output is placed in the _/_c_e_l_l directory under the user's cur-
       rent GRASS mapset.

       iinnppuutt==_n_a_m_e
              Name of an existing TIFF raster file to be imported.

       oouuttppuutt==_n_a_m_e
              Name to be assigned to resultant binary raster map layer.



       The program prompts the user to enter the name of the TIFF raster  file
       to be converted and the name to be assigned to the GRASS raster file to
       contain the resultant image. Currently "TIFF/uncompressed", "TIFF/Pack-
       Bits-compression" and "TIFF/deflate" formats are supported.  Other com-
       pression schemes may not be read correctly.   LZW  compression  is  not
       supported due to UNISYS patent.


       If  the  image is a 24-bit RGB TIFF, then the output will be split into
       respective red, green and blue band files; each having the _o_u_t_p_u_t  name
       as its prefix followed by _._r, _._g or _._b, respectively.  Color composites
       can be displayed with d.rgb.


       If a TIFF World file exists with an extension of "tfw", "tifw",  "TFW",
       or  "TIFW",  it  will  be used to set the boundary coordinates and cell
       size.  Rotation in the TIFF World file is  not  supported  (second  and
       third  numbers),  and  if  present  the  TIFF will be imported as an XY
       (unreferenced) image.  If no TIFF World file exists,  the  user  should
       adjust  boundary  coordinates  stored  in  the cell header after import
       using _r_._s_u_p_p_o_r_t .


       A sample TFW file opened up would look like:
                              6.00
                              0.00
                              0.00
                             -6.00
                        1709053.00
                         807714.00

                Line 1 - Cell size in the "X" direction
                Line 2 - "Rotation" term for the row
                Line 3 - "Rotation" term for the column
                Line 4 - Cell size in the "Y" direction
                Line 5 - Easting value of insertion point "X"
                Line 6 - Northing value of insertion point "Y"

       Note: The y-scale (4) is negative because the origins of an image and a
       geographic  coordinates system are different. The origin of an image is
       located in the upper-left corner, whereas the origin of the map coordi-
       nate  system  is  located  in  the lower-left corner. Row values in the
       image increase from the origin downward, while y-coordinate  values  in
       the map increase from the origin upward.

NNOOTTEE
       This module only supports TIFF's conforming to the base TIFF 6 specifi-
       cation.  These include monochrome, grayscale, palette  and  RGB  ("True
       Color"), with at most 8 bits per "sample".  Other features, like larger
       bits/sample, floating point  (or  rational)  samples,  alpha  blending,
       transparency masks, and multiband images, are not currently handled.


       This  module  also doesn't handle true GeoTIFF's (those with coordinate
       reference information actually embedded in  the  TIFF  file).   So  the
       assumption  with  the TIFF world file is that it make sense in whatever
       coordinate system the current region settings return.
