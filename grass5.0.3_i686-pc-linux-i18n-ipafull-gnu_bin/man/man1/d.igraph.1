       _d_._i_g_r_a_p_h  is  the  GRASS  interface to the GRASS graphics driver on the
       Intergraph workstations.  GRASS can be run from an  ascii  terminal  or
       from  a  window on the Intergraph workstation.  There are some pitfalls
       to running GRASS from a window; these are discussed in the  NOTES  sec-
       tion below.


       When  _d_._i_g_r_a_p_h  is  run a pull-down menu will appear on the workstation
       screen and some information will be displayed on  the  ascii  terminal.
       The  pull-down  menu,  which  works  the same way other Intergraph pull
       down-menus work, will look like this:
         _______________________
         |  GRASS Commands      |
         |  start/select        |
         |  stop                |
         |  GRASS Graphics      |
         |  resize/move         |
         |  virtual screens    >|
         |  colors             >|
         | EXIT                 |
         |______________________|

       The menu is divided into  two  categories:  _G_R_A_S_S  _C_o_m_m_a_n_d_s  and  _G_R_A_S_S
       _G_r_a_p_h_i_c_s.  _G_R_A_S_S _C_o_m_m_a_n_d_s in the pull-down menu have GRASS command-line
       equivalents. These command-line equivalents can be used without running
       _d_._i_g_r_a_p_h,  although  users  may find the pull-down menu commands easier
       and faster to use.  On the other hand, there are no command-line equiv-
       alents  for  the  _G_R_A_S_S _G_r_a_p_h_i_c_s commands in the pull-down menu.  These
       commands, which must be run from inside _d_._i_g_r_a_p_h, enable you to  modify
       the size, placement, and number of colors, of the graphics window.


       The  first command under _G_R_A_S_S _C_o_m_m_a_n_d_s is _s_t_a_r_t_/_s_e_l_e_c_t; selecting this
       command with the mouse will start the graphics driver _I_G_R_A_P_H  and  then
       select  it  for  output.   This pull-down menu command is equivalent to
       typing the following commands at the GRASS command line:

       dd..mmoonn ssttaarrtt==IIGGRRAAPPHH
              (start and select the IGRAPH graphics driver)

       or

       dd..mmoonn --ss ssttaarrtt==IIGGRRAAPPHH
              (start but don't select the IGRAPH driver)

       dd..mmoonn sseelleecctt==IIGGRRAAPPHH
              (select the already started IGRAPH driver)

       Using the _s_t_a_r_t_/_s_e_l_e_c_t option saves the user from having  to  type  the
       above  command(s).  After the graphics driver is started, the pull-down
       menu will disappear and the _d_._i_g_r_a_p_h program  will  exit,  leaving  the
       user  at  the GRASS prompt.  When the second command (_s_t_o_p) under _G_R_A_S_S
       _C_o_m_m_a_n_d_s is selected, the graphics driver  _I_G_R_A_P_H  will  stop  and  the
       GRASS window will disappear.  The equivalent GRASS command-line command
       is: dd..mmoonn ssttoopp==IIGGRRAAPPHH.


       The second category (_G_R_A_S_S _G_r_a_p_h_i_c_s) in  the  pull-down  menu  contains
       three  commands  written  for  the GRASS graphics driver _I_G_R_A_P_H.  These
       commands establish parameters for size, location, and number of  colors
       the  graphics driver will use to create a GRASS graphics window. There-
       fore, they should be run _b_e_f_o_r_e starting the graphics driver  with  the
       _s_t_a_r_t_/_s_e_l_e_c_t  command.  These parameters will not affect a GRASS window
       that has already been started, but they will be saved and used the next
       time the graphics driver is started.


       The  first  command  in  the  second category is _r_e_s_i_z_e_/_m_o_v_e.  When the
       _r_e_s_i_z_e_/_m_o_v_e command is selected, the pull-down menu will disappear  and
       a  special _R_e_s_i_z_e window, colored grey, will be created on the graphics
       monitor.  The _R_e_s_i_z_e window will be the exact  size  and  at  the  same
       location  as  the GRASS graphics window would be if the graphics driver
       had been started.  Use the resize and move icons on the  _R_e_s_i_z_e  window
       to  modify  the  window.   When  the desired size and position has been
       achieved, ddeelleettee the _R_e_s_i_z_e window.  To do this, move the mouse to  the
       left  side  of the icon strip at the top of the _R_e_s_i_z_e window and click
       the mouse on the small box  containing an XX.  Note that the window size
       is  displayed  on  the ascii terminal in which the _d_._i_g_r_a_p_h program was
       started.  Now, each time the graphics monitor is  started,  the  window
       will be the same size and at the same location as the _R_e_s_i_z_e window.


       The  second  command  is  _v_i_r_t_u_a_l _s_c_r_e_e_n_s.  This command has a sub-menu
       with a listing of virtual screen numbers (from 0 to 3).  Of the virtual
       screen  numbers  listed (0 to 3), only one or two of those numbers will
       be active and selectable from the sub-menu.  The number  of  selectable
       virtual  screen  numbers will depend on the type of workstation and its
       virtual screen configuration.  When the _I_G_R_A_P_H driver  is  started,  it
       will  create  a  GRASS  window  on  the virtual screen whose number was
       picked by this command.  Note that the current virtual screen number is
       displayed  on  the  ascii  terminal  n  which  the _d_._i_g_r_a_p_h program was
       started.


       The third graphics command is _c_o_l_o_r_s.  This command has a sub-menu with
       a  listing of the possible range of active colors the workstations will
       support (16 to 512).  The number of active colors is determined by  the
       number  of  planes the graphics processor supports  (9 planes will give
       512 active colors).  We do not suggest running GRASS  with  fewer  than
       225566 active colors.


       Each  workstation can be configured differently with regard to the num-
       ber of virtual screens and the available number of colors.   A  certain
       amount  of  testing will have to been done to determine what works best
       with a particular workstation.


       The last command is the _E_X_I_T command.  This command is  used  to  leave
       the _d_._i_g_r_a_p_h program.

       Once  the GRASS graphics driver is started, a window will appear on the
       screen.  The GRASS graphics window is mouse-activated.  The mouse  must
       be  within  the  GRASS  graphics window for the true GRASS colors to be
       displayed on the graphics window.  The mouse doesn't have to be clicked
       inside the window; just moving the mouse within the window is enough to
       activate the window.  While the mouse is  outside  the  GRASS  graphics
       window, the colors in the graphics window will be random.

       Obsolete for LINUX, of course!


       When  using the GRASS program _d_._c_o_l_o_r_s or the _i_n_t_e_r_a_c_t selection in the
       _d_._d_i_s_p_l_a_y program, the mouse must be within the GRASS  graphics  window
       when  toggling  or highlighting categories.  If the mouse is not within
       the graphics window, the colors will not represent  the  true  category
       colors.   Using  the  two  programs mentioned above while running GRASS
       from an Intergraph window (ascii window) creates a problem;  The  mouse
       must  be  within the graphics window at all times for those programs to
       work properly, but the mouse also must be moved to the ascii window  to
       activate the ascii window so that commands can be typed.  This is not a
       problem when GRASS is run from an ascii terminal, because the mouse can
       be left within the GRASS graphics window at all times.
