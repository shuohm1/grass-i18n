       Reads  a GRASS raster map as input.  Calculates textural features based
       on spatial dependence matrices for north-south,  east-west,  northwest,
       and  southwest directions using a 3x3 neighborhood (i.e., a distance of
       1).  Writes to standard output.  Be sure to carefully set your  resolu-
       tion  (using  _g_._r_e_g_i_o_n)  before running this program, or else your com-
       puter could run out of memory.  Also, make sure that  your  raster  map
       has no more than 255 categories.

       The program can run incredibly slow for large raster files (larger than
       64 x 64) and command line options are limited.


       The method for finding (14) the maximal correlation coefficient,  which
       requires  finding the second largest eigenvalue of a matrix Q, does not
       always converge.


       It would be interesting to write  raster  files  to  map  features  for
       neighborhoods,  with  some sort of quantization to record category val-
       ues.  This may be useful for image  classification  schemes,  but  this
       exercise is left to the reader (the changes would be fairly trivial).
