       This  program, _p_._p_p_m, reads a user-specified portable pixmap (ppm) file
       and outputs it to the currently selected printer (see  _p_._s_e_l_e_c_t).   The
       _i_n_p_u_t ppm file should be one that has been created using the PPM utili-
       ties developed by Jeff Poskanzer.  These utilities can  import  various
       image  formats  (including  Sun  raster, X Windows pixmaps, and others)
       into the PPM formats _p_p_m (color pixmaps), _p_g_m (grey  scale  maps),  and
       _p_b_m (black and white bit-maps).


       If  the  image doesn't fit the output device, it won't get printed.  If
       you want the image printed (but clipped), use the pp..ppppmm --ff  option,  or
       scale the input using _p_p_m_s_c_a_l_e, or rotate the image using _p_p_m_r_o_t_a_t_e (if
       it will fit that way -- otherwise you might have to scale it as  well).
       If  the  image  doesn't  fit, _p_._p_p_m will tell you what scaling value to
       enter to _p_p_m_s_c_a_l_e that will make it fit.

       If the user is running GRASS under SunOS, the following  command  could
       be used to send a monitor screen image to the printer:


       ssccrreeeenndduummpp || rraassttttooppppmm || pp..ppppmm





       If you are running suntools, the user might type:


       sslleeeepp 1100;; ssccrreeeenndduummpp || rraassttttooppppmm || ppppmmrroottaattee 9900 || pp..ppppmm



       The UNIX _s_l_e_e_p command allows you time to arrange the frames before the
       screen dump starts.  The _p_p_m_r_o_t_a_t_e is usually needed  because  the  Sun
       screens  are  wider  than  they  are long (and wider than 1024 pixels -
       which is the width of most of our printers).


       If you are running X, the user might type:


       xxwwdd || xxwwddttooppppmm || ppppmmrroottaattee 9900 || pp..ppppmm


NNOOTTEESS
       This program only supports the ppm binary format (P6).


       Maximum color level is 255.  If the ppm file has more color levels, use
       _p_p_m_c_s_c_a_l_e to reduce the number of colors.


       No scaling is done.  Use _p_p_m_s_c_a_l_e to change image size.


       No rotation is done.  Use _p_p_m_r_o_t_a_t_e to rotate the image.
