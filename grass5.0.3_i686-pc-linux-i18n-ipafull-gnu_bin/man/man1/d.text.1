       _d_._t_e_x_t draws text in the active display frame on the graphics  monitor.
       Text  can  be provided through standard input or redirected from a file
       (using the UNIX redirection mechanism).

   PPaarraammeetteerrss::
       ssiizzee==_v_a_l_u_e
              Height of letters, stated as a percent of the available  display
              frame height.

              Options: 0 - 100

              Default: 5

       ccoolloorr==_n_a_m_e
              Sets display text color to _n_a_m_e.

              Options: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, gray,
              white, and black

              Default: _g_r_a_y

       lliinnee==_v_a_l_u_e
              The screen line number on which the first line of text  will  be
              drawn.

              (Line 1 is at the top of the active display frame.)

              Options: 1 - 1000

              Default: 1

       In  addition  to the options provided on the command line, colors, text
       size, font type, and boldness, can be adjusted  with  commands  in  the
       standard input (i.e., if the user invokes _d_._t_e_x_t without options on the
       command line, and then assigns values to these options on lines  within
       the  standard  input).   In  this case, the user also sees the standard
       GRASS parser interface.

   CCoommmmaannddss::
       .C _c_o_l_o_r
              (where _c_o_l_o_r is one of the available colors) causes text appear-
              ing on subsequent lines to be drawn in that color.

       ..SS  _s_i_z_e
              (where  _s_i_z_e  is a percentage within the range 0 to 100) adjusts
              text size.  Note that a size of 10 would allow 10  lines  to  be
              drawn  in the active display frame, 5 would allow the drawing of
              20 lines, and 50 would allow the drawing of 2 lines.



       ..FF _f_o_n_t
              (where _f_o_n_t is one of the  fonts  known  by  the  GRASS  program
              _d_._f_o_n_t) manipulates the font type. Available fonts are listed in
              the GRASS manual entry for _d_._f_o_n_t.  The default font  type  used
              (if  unspecified  by  the  user) is _r_o_m_a_n_s.  Run the GRASS macro
              _s_h_o_w_._f_o_n_t_s_._s_h to see what these fonts look like.

       ..BB 11   stipulates that following text be printed in bboolldd.  This command
              means _b_o_l_d _o_n.

       ..BB 00   turns  _b_o_l_d _o_f_f of all text appearing on lines beneath it. (_B_o_l_d
              _o_f_f is used by default, if unspecified by the user.)


EEXXAAMMPPLLEE
       The following command will print the short phrase "This is  a  test  of
       d.text"  in  the  active display frame using the color yellow, in bold,
       and using 4/100'ths (4%) of the active frame's vertical space per line:



       dd..tteexxtt 11 This is a test of d.text

       The  user  presses  _c_o_n_t_r_o_l_-_d (the "ctrl" and "d" keys) to end input to
       _d_._t_e_x_t (equal to EOF).

NNOOTTEESS
       Note that the GRASS command _d_._t_i_t_l_e creates  map  TITLEs  in  a  format
       suitable for input to _d_._t_e_x_t.


       _d_._t_e_x_t  needs  escape sequences that can be used within lines to change
       colors, boldness, and perhaps size.
