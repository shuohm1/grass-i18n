       produces a GRASS _s_i_t_e___l_i_s_t_s file containing the calculated centroids of
       these clumps.

       This  program  computes  the  cubic  volume  of data contained in user-
       defined clumps.  _r_._v_o_l_u_m_e outputs:

              The category value assigned to each clump formed  by  the  _c_l_u_m_p
              map  layer.   This value is stored under the "Cat Number" column
              (field 1) in the output table.

              The average category value of the cells found in a _d_a_t_a map that
              fall  within  the  boundaries of each clump in a _c_l_u_m_p map.  The
              table stores this value under  the  "Average  in  Clump"  column
              (field 2).

              The  summed  total  value of the category values assigned to the
              cells falling within each of these clumps.  This value is output
              under the "Data Total" column (field 3).

              The  number  of  cells  from  the  _d_a_t_a map that fall within the
              boundaries of each clump formed by the _c_l_u_m_p  map  layer.   This
              cell  count is stored under the "# Cells in Clump" column (field
              4) in the output table.

              The centroid easting of each clump.

              The centroid northing of each clump.  These  values  are  output
              under  the  "Centroid  Easting"  and "Centroid Northing" columns
              (fields 5 and 6) in the output.

              The total "volume" of each clump. For each clump, the volume  is
              calculated  by multiplying the area of each cell by its category
              value, and taking the sum of this value for all cells within the
              clump.  Since, in GRASS, each cell in the _d_a_t_a map will have the
              same cell dimensions (i.e., the same area), this  is  equivalent
              to  multiplying  the area of one cell by the "Data Total" column
              (field 3).
              (The area of each cell is equal to the product of its  east-west
              resolution by its north-south resolution. See _g_._r_e_g_i_o_n.)



       Results  are  sent  to  standard output in the form of a table.  If the
       user sets the --ff flag, this table will be output in a form suitable for
       input  to  such  UNIX  programs as _a_w_k and _s_e_d; the table's columns are
       stored as colon-separated fields.  The user can also (optionally) elect
       to  store  clump  centroids in a GRASS _s_i_t_e___l_i_s_t_s file. A sample output
       report is shown below.


       _r_._v_o_l_u_m_e works with  the  current  geographic  region  definitions  and
       respects the current MASK.


       The  user  can  run  _r_._v_o_l_u_m_e non-interactively by specifying parameter
       values on the command line. If the user omits parameter values from the
       command  line,  the  program  will  prompt the user for input using the
       standard interface described in the manual entry for _p_a_r_s_e_r.

       For  ease  of example, it is assumed that each clump in the _f_i_e_l_d_s_._o_n_l_y
       map layer is a field, that cell category values in  the  _e_l_e_v_a_t_i_o_n  map
       layer  represent  actual  elevation values in meters, and that the data
       base is a UTM data base (in meters).  This means that field  #1  (clump
       #1)  contains  64  cells;  the average elevation in field #1 is 1181.09
       meters. The sum of all of the elevation values assigned to cells within
       field  #1  is  75590 meters. The volume (x*y*z) of space in field #1 is
       equal to 755900000 cubic meters.


       The "Data Total" column is the sum of the cell category values  appear-
       ing  in  the  _e_l_e_v_a_t_i_o_n map layer, within each field of the _f_i_e_l_d_s_._o_n_l_y
       map layer.  The Total Volume is the sum multiplied by the  e-w  resolu-
       tion times the n-s resolution.

CCEENNTTRROOIIDDSS
       The  coordinates of the clump centroids are the same as those stored in
       the GRASS _s_i_t_e___l_i_s_t_s file (if one was requested).  They are  guaranteed
       to  fall  on  a  cell  of  the appropriate category; thus, they are not
       always the true, mathematical centroids. However, they will always fall
       at a cell center.

FFOORRMMAATT OOFF SSIITTEE LLIISSTT
       For each line of above table the GRASS _s_i_t_e___l_i_s_t_s file reads:


       easting|northing|#cat v=volume a=average t=sum n=count



       This  can  be  converted  directly  to a raster map layer in which each
       point is assigned to a separate category.

AAPPPPLLIICCAATTIIOONNSS
       By preprocessing the _e_l_e_v_a_t_i_o_n map layer with _r_._m_a_p_c_a_l_c and using suit-
       able  masking  or clump maps, very interesting applications can be done
       with _r_._v_o_l_u_m_e.  For instance, one can calculate: the volume of rock  in
       a  potential  quarry; cut/fill volumes for roads; and, water volumes in
       potential reservoirs.  Data layers of other measures of real values can
       also be used.

NNOOTTEESS
       The  output  is  sent  to the terminal screen. The user can capture the
       output in a file using the UNIX redirection mechanism, as in  the  fol-
       lowing example: rr..vvoolluummee dd==_d_a_t_a___m_a_p cc==_c_l_u_m_p___m_a_p ss==_s_i_t_e___l_i_s_t > _t_a_b_l_e_._o_u_t



       Output can also be sent directly to the printer, as shown below: rr..vvooll--
       uummee dd==_d_a_t_a___m_a_p cc==_c_l_u_m_p___m_a_p ss==_s_i_t_e___l_i_s_t | lpr



       The  user should be aware of what units of measurement the cell e-w and
       n-s resolution are in, and in what units the _d_a_t_a map's  cell  category
       values are stated (since these three values will be multiplied together
       to produce the volume).


       This program respects the current mask, and uses this mask as the _c_l_u_m_p
       map layer if none is specified by the user.
