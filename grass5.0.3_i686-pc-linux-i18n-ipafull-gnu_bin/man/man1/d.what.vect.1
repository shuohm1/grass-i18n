       dd..wwhhaatt..vveecctt  - Allows the user to interactively query the category con-
       tents of a (binary) vector map layer at user-selected locations  within
       the current geographic region.

       _d_._w_h_a_t_._v_e_c_t  outputs  the category value(s) associated with user-speci-
       fied location(s) in a user-specified vector  map  layer.  This  program
       currently returns only category values for line types in the user-spec-
       ified vector file.


       The program will query the contents of the vector map  layer  named  by
       the  user  on the command line. This map layer must exist in the user's
       current mapset search path.


       The program activates the mouse, and expects the user to  indicate  the
       location(s)  to  be  queried  by depressing a mouse button over desired
       location(s) within the current geographic region in the active  display
       frame on the graphic monitor.


       Alternatively user can specify ttaabbllee== and kkeeyy== and window with database
       attributes will be opened for each selected object with assigned  cate-
       gory.

   FFllaagg::
       --11     Identify and query just one point location. Only one mouse click
              is executed. This option is provided for shell scripts and  pro-
              grams that want to obtain only one point from the user.

       --tt     Provide  only  terse output. This option is provided to simplify
              the parsing of output by  other  programs.  Database  connection
              must be set up by db.connect first.


   PPaarraammeetteerr::
       mmaapp==_n_a_m_e
              Name  of  an  existing  binary  vector  map in the user's mapset
              search path.

       ttaabbllee==_n_a_m_e
              Name of database table containing attributes.

       kkeeyy==_n_a_m_e
              Name of database table key (id) column.

       A sample _d_._w_h_a_t_._v_e_c_t session is given below. Although it is not  neces-
       sary  that  the  user  first  display a vector map to be queried in the
       active display frame, it is helpful to have a map displayed  there  for
       reference.



       dd..vveecctt mmaapp==_r_o_a_d_s_._2_4_0_0_0
              Displays the 1:24,000 scale _r_o_a_d_s vector map layer on the graph-
              ics monitor.


       dd..wwhhaatt..vveecctt mmaapp==_r_o_a_d_s_._2_4_0_0_0 After typing this, the user moves the mouse
       to a desired location on the displayed _r_o_a_d_s map layer, and presses the
       left mouse button to query the category value of the _r_o_a_d_s  vector  map
       at this location. The program then outputs the category value of a line
       type corresponding to this user-selected map location, for  the  vector
       map queried by the user.


       The query may be repeated as often as desired using the left mouse but-
       ton.  The right button on the mouse is used  to  quit  the  _d_._w_h_a_t_._v_e_c_t
       session.


       Users can also use this program inside of shell scripts that require as
       input a map category value and a mouse button depressed.  Users can set
       the -1 flag to run _d_._w_h_a_t_._v_e_c_t only once, and return only the map cate-
       gory value found and the number of the mouse button  depressed.  (Mouse
       button return values are as follows: 0 indicates no button was pressed,
       1 indicates that the left mouse button was  pressed,  2  indicates  the
       middle  button was pressed, and 3 indicates that the right mouse button
       was pressed.)

NNOOTTEESS
       Currently, _d_._w_h_a_t_._v_e_c_t only outputs category values for lines.  It does
       not  output  category  labels  for lines, nor output category values or
       category labels for areas in a vector file.


       _d_._w_h_a_t_._v_e_c_t will always print its output to the user's terminal screen.
       _d_._w_h_a_t_._v_e_c_t  output  can  be redirected into a file; however, if it is,
       the output will go both to the screen and to the  file.   For  example:
       dd..wwhhaatt..vveecctt mmaapp==_r_o_a_d_s >> wwhhaatt..oouutt

       will  both send _d_._w_h_a_t_._v_e_c_t output to the screen and capture its output
       in the file named _w_h_a_t_._o_u_t.


       _d_._w_h_a_t_._r_a_s_t can be used to interactively query the  map  category  con-
       tents of multiple raster map layers at user-selected locations.
