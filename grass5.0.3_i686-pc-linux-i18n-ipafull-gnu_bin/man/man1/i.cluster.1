DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       _i_._c_l_u_s_t_e_r performs the first pass in the  GRASS  two-pass  unsupervised
       classification  of  imagery,  while the GRASS program _i_._m_a_x_l_i_k executes
       the second pass. Both programs must be run to complete the unsupervised
       classification.


       _i_._c_l_u_s_t_e_r  is  a  clustering  algorithm that reads through the (raster)
       imagery  data  and  builds  pixel  clusters  based  on   the   spectral
       reflectances  of the pixels.  The pixel clusters are imagery categories
       that can be related to land cover types on the  ground.   The  spectral
       distributions  of  the  clusters (which will be the land cover spectral
       signatures) are influenced by six parameters  set  by  the  user.   The
       first parameter set by the user is the initial number of clusters to be
       discriminated.  _i_._c_l_u_s_t_e_r starts by generating spectral signatures  for
       this  number  of  clusters and "attempts" to end up with this number of
       clusters during the clustering process.  The resulting number of  clus-
       ters  and their spectral distributions, however, are also influenced by
       the range of the spectral values (category values) in the  image  files
       and  the  other parameters set by the user.  These parameters are:  the
       minimum cluster size, minimum cluster separation, the  percent  conver-
       gence,  the  maximum  number of iterations, and the row and column sam-
       pling intervals.


       The cluster spectral signatures that result  are  composed  of  cluster
       means  and  covariance  matrices.   These  cluster means and covariance
       matrices are used in the second pass (_i_._m_a_x_l_i_k) to classify the  image.
       The  clusters  or  spectral classes result can be related to land cover
       types on the ground.

       The program can be run either non-interactively  or  interactively.  It
       will  be  run non-interactively if the user specifies the name of group
       file, the name of subgroup file, the name of a file to  contain  result
       signatures,  the  initial  number  of clusters to be discriminated, and
       optionally other parameters (see below) on the command line  using  the
       form:    ii..cclluusstteerr    [--qq]    ggrroouupp==_n_a_m_e   ssuubbggrroouupp==_n_a_m_e   ssiiggffiillee==_n_a_m_e

       where the _g_r_o_u_p should contain the imagery files that the  user  wishes
       to  classify.   The  _s_u_b_g_r_o_u_p is a subset of this group.  The user must
       create a group and subgroup by running the GRASS program _i_._g_r_o_u_p before
       running  _i_._c_l_u_s_t_e_r.   The subgroup should contain only the imagery band
       files that the user wishes to classify.  Note that this  subgroup  must
       contain more than one band file.  The purpose of the group and subgroup
       is to collect map layers for classification or analysis. The _s_i_g_f_i_l_e is
       the  file  to  contain result signatures which can be used as input for
       _i_._m_a_x_l_i_k.  The classes value is the initial number of  clusters  to  be
       discriminated;  any  parameter values left unspecified are set to their
       default values. Alternatively, the program will be run interactively if
       the user types only _i_._c_l_u_s_t_e_r; in this case the program will prompt the
       user for parameter values using the standard GRASS _p_a_r_s_e_r.

              The name of the group file which contains the imagery files that

       ssuubbggrroouupp==_n_a_m_e
              The  name  of the subset of the group specified in group option,
              which must contain only imagery band files  and  more  than  one
              band  file.  The user must create a group and a subgroup by run-
              ning the GRASS program _i_._g_r_o_u_p before running _i_._c_l_u_s_t_e_r.

       ssiiggffiillee==_n_a_m_e
              The name assigned to output signature file which contains signa-
              tures of classes and can be used as the input file for the GRASS
              program _i_._m_a_x_l_i_k for an unsupervised classification.

       ccllaasssseess==_v_a_l_u_e
              The number of clusters that will initially be identified in  the
              clustering process before the iterations begin.

       sseeeedd==_n_a_m_e
              The  name  of a seed signature file is optional. The seed signa-
              tures are signatures that contain cluster means  and  covariance
              matrices  which  were  calculated  prior  to  the current run of
              _i_._c_l_u_s_t_e_r. They may be acquired from a previously run of _i_._c_l_u_s_-
              _t_e_r  or from a supervised classification signature training site
              section (e.g., using the signature file output by _i_._c_l_a_s_s).  The
              purpose  of  seed signatures is to optimize the cluster decision
              boundaries (means) for the number of clusters specified.

              These numbers are optional with default values based on the size
              of  the  data  set such that the total pixels to be processed is
              approximately 10,000 (consider round up).

       iitteerraattiioonnss==_v_a_l_u_e
              This parameter determines the maximum number of iterations which
              is  greater  than  the number of iterations predicted to achieve
              the optimum percent convergence. The default value is 30. If the
              number of iterations reaches the maximum designated by the user;
              the user may want to rerun _i_._c_l_u_s_t_e_r with  a  higher  number  of
              iterations (see _r_e_p_o_r_t_f_i_l_e).
              Default: 30

       ccoonnvveerrggeennccee==_v_a_l_u_e
              A  high  percent convergence is the point at which cluster means
              become stable during the iteration process.  The  default  value
              is  98.0  percent.  When clusters are being created, their means
              constantly change as pixels are assigned to them and  the  means
              are  recalculated  to include the new pixel.  After all clusters
              have been created, _i_._c_l_u_s_t_e_r begins iterations that change clus-
              ter  means  by  maximizing the distances between them.  As these
              means shift, a higher  and  higher  convergence  is  approached.
              Because  means  will never become totally static, a percent con-
              vergence and a maximum number of iterations are supplied to stop
              the  iterative  process.   The  percent  convergence  should  be
              reached before the maximum number of iterations. If the  maximum
              number of iterations is reached, it is probable that the desired
              percent convergence was not reached. The number of iterations is
              reported  in  the  cluster  statistics  in  the report file (see
              _r_e_p_o_r_t_f_i_l_e).
              Default: 98.0

       sseeppaarraattiioonn==_v_a_l_u_e
              This is the minimum separation  below  which  clusters  will  be
              merged  in the iteration process. The default value is 0.0. This
              is an image-specific number (a "magic" number) that  depends  on
              the image data being classified and the number of final clusters
              that are acceptable. Its determination requires experimentation.
              Note  that  as  the  minimum  class  (or  cluster) separation is
              increased, the maximum  number  of  iterations  should  also  be
              increased  to  achieve this separation with a high percentage of
              convergence (see _c_o_n_v_e_r_g_e_n_c_e).
              Default: 0.0

       mmiinn__ssiizzee==_v_a_l_u_e
              This is the minimum number of pixels that will be used to define
              a  cluster,  and  is  therefore the minimum number of pixels for
              which means and covariance matrices will be calculated.
              Default: 17

       rreeppoorrttffiillee==_n_a_m_e
              The reportfile is  an  optional  parameter  which  contains  the
              result, i.e., the statistics for each cluster. Also included are
              the resulting percent convergence for the clusters,  the  number
              of  iterations that was required to achieve the convergence, and
              the separability matrix.
