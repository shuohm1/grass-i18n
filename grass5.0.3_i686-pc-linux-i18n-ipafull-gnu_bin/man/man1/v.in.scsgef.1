       _v_._i_n_._s_c_s_g_e_f allows a user to create a GRASS vector file from a  SCS-GEF
       format ASCII file.



        1.  The program will first request the name of the SCS-GEF file to be
              read  in,  it expects to find the data in the current directory.
              It is suggested to create a _g_e_f directory and  put  all  SCS-GEF
              data there.


       2.  The program will then request the name of a GRASS vector file.


       3.   The  program will then request the name of a SUBJECT file.  A sub-
       ject file will be used to assign GRASS category codes  to  the  SCS-GEF
       data.   It  is  structured the same as a _d_i_g___c_a_t_s category file.  It is
       suggested that a SUBJ directory be created in the GRASS location and  a
       file  containing  all SCS-GEF text labels by category be created.  This
       will be required to provide consistancy  across  several  maps  (quads)
       within  one  location.   The user may use the _v_i text editor or the SCS
       macro _m_a_k_e___s_u_b_j_e_c_t to create it.


       4.  The program will then read the SCSGEF header information,  interac-
       tively  present  information that was available, and request additional
       data of the user.  These questions are :


       Name of their organization. (from SCS-GEF)
       Digitized Date.             (from SCS-GEF)
       Map Name.                   (from SCS-GEF)
       Map Location.               (from SCS-GEF)
       Other Information.          (from SCS-GEF)
       State FIPS code.
       County FIPS code.
       Present GEF Coord. System (table, stplane, ll, utm).
       Coordinate System Desired (utm, stplane, ll, albers).


       The program will then actively read the SCS-GEF data file  and  process
       it,


       scripts  contains  SCS macro _m_a_k_e___1___g_e_f.  This macro makes one file out
       of the three (3) files found in SCS-GEF (see SCS-GEF technical specifi-
       cations  for more information).  The macro must be run on each data set
       BEFORE _v_._i_n_._s_c_s_._g_e_f.
