       _x_g_a_n_i_m is a tool for animating a  series  of  GRASS  raster  files.  At
       startup,  a  graphics  window is opened containing VCR-like button con-
       trols for: rewind, reverse play, step back, stop, step forward, forward
       play,  loop,  swing, slower, faster, show filenames, current frame no.,
       and Exit. The image is displayed above or to the left of the  controls.
       Each raster file is read into memory, then the animation is played once
       beginning to end. The user may then replay the series or play  continu-
       ous animation by using the buttons.


       The  user  may  define  up  to four "views", or sub-windows, to animate
       simultaneously. e.g., View 1 could be rainfall, View 2  flooded  areas,
       View  3  damage to bridges or levees, View 4 other economic damage, all
       animated as a time series. There is an arbitrary limit of 100 files per
       view  (100  animation  frames),  but  the  practical  limit may be less
       depending on the window size and amount of available RAM.


       The environment variable XGANIM_SIZE is checked for a value to  use  as
       the  dimension,  in  pixels,  of the longest dimension of the animation
       window. If XGANIM_SIZE is not set, the animation size defaults  to  the
       rows  &  columns in the current GRASS region, scaling if necessary to a
       default minimum size of 600 and maximum of 900. The resolution  of  the
       current GRASS region is maintained, independent of window size.  Resiz-
       ing the window after the program is running will have no effect on  the
       animation size.


       UNIX  -  style  wild cards may be used with the command line version in
       place of a raster file name, but it must be quoted.


       Example:


       _x_g_a_n_i_m _v_i_e_w_1_=_"_r_a_i_n_[_1_-_9_]_"_,_"_r_a_i_n_1_[_0_-_2_]_" _v_i_e_w_2_=_"_t_e_m_p_*_"


       If the number of files differs for each view, the view with the  fewest
       files will determine the number of frames in the animation.

       On some displays that need to use private colormaps, the interface but-
       tons may become difficult to see.
