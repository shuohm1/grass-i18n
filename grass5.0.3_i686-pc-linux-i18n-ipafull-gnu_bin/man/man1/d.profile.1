       This  command  works  only interactively. It clears the entire graphics
       screen and provides a graphical interaction allowing the  selection  of
       transects  for  which profiles are then generated. Input parameters can
       be specified on the command line for quicker start-up.

       First, you will be presented with a  prompt  asking  you  to  choose  a
       raster  map  layer  to  be  profiled.  Then you will be prompted for an
       optional display raster.  The optional display  raster  will  be  shown
       rather  than  the  profiled  raster.  This is useful to be able to more
       easily see ground features, such as might be visible in an aerial photo
       or  satellite  image. Finally, you will be prompted for the name prefix
       for output file(s) containing the profile data.  This  is  an  optional
       feature.


       After  parameters  are given, the raster layer will be displayed in the
       left half of the graphics monitor, and the right half will  be  divided
       into  four  frames.  There will also be two frames along the top of the
       monitor: a mouse-button menu frame on the left, and a status  frame  on
       the right.


       The  mouse-button  menu  initially offers you three options: Mouse But-
       tons:

       Left: Where am I?

       Middle: Mark FIRST Point of Profile Line.

       Right: QUIT this.


       You may query the displayed raster map layer by indicating points  with
       the left mouse-button. The coordinates and category value of each point
       that you indicate will be displayed on in the  status  frame.   If  you
       mark the first point of the profile line you will be presented with the
       following mouse-button menu: Mouse Buttons:

       Left: Where am I?

       Middle: Mark SECOND Point of Profile Line.

       Right: QUIT this.


       Once you mark the second point of the profile line,  the  profile  line
       will be labeled (with a letter from A to D) and displayed in one of the
       four display frames on the right hand side of the screen. You will then
       be presented with a third mouse-button menu: Mouse Buttons:

       Left: DO ANOTHER

       Middle: CLEAR DISPLAY

       Right: QUIT this.


       If you would like to view another profile, click on the left mouse-but-
       ton.  If you would like to redisplay the raster map layer and clear out
       the four profile frames, click on the middle mouse-button. If you would
       like to quit, then click on the right button.


       If you selected the pplloottffiillee option, you will have  up  to  four  files
       starting  with  the _n_a_m_e and followed by a suffix of the plot letter _A_,
       _B_, _C_, or _D.  The plots that are written to these files reflect the last
       of  each plot done with that letter (i.e. They will match what's in the
       display when you quit).


       The format of the plot files is not geared toward any particular  soft-
       ware,  but should be easy to coax into a number of other programs.  The
       first three lines contain some header information about the plot,  each
       prefixed  with  a  #  sign  to denote a comment.  A fourth comment line
       describes the data that follows.  It consists of the  distance  (always
       in meters), the cell value (in whatever units it is in), the easting in
       decimal format, and the northing in decimal format.  The number of val-
       ues  will  vary depending on the length of the profile, cell resolution
       and the slope angle of the profile line.  Below  is  an  example  of  a
       plotfile:


       # Profile A of elev.ft@snows

       #   From   (702879.29679757,   4287317.55920185)  to  (702722.40973589,
       4287061.72632285)

       # Stats: Count = 644, Min = 2424.658936, Max = 2513.246094

       # dist value east north

       0.000000 2513.246094 702879.102364 4287317.516912

       0.000000 2513.246094 702878.713496 4287317.118970

       0.556395 2513.246094 702878.324629 4287316.721029

       1.112790 2513.246094 702878.324629 4287316.323088

       You might notice the first two 'dist'  values  in  the  profile  output
       above  are  both zero.  This is due to the fact the cell resolution for
       this file is less than one meter, and so the function  that  calculates
       the distance considers the distance between the first cell and the sec-
       ond to be zero.  You might also notice, the coordinates  given  in  the
       header  and  displayed  on screen are slightly different from the first
       and last coordinates given in the profile data output.  This is because
       the profile data output finds the eastings and northings for the center
       of the cells while the coordinate  transformations  from  mouse  clicks
       might  yield slightly different coordinates which still fall within the
       same cell boundaries.  The difference should always be  less  than  the
       distance  between  the center and any corner (not edge!) of the cell at
       the resolution of the profiled raster.


       Only four output plotfiles can be made.  Each time  a  new  profile  is
       run,  the  plotfile is immediately written to the file _n_a_m_e._l_e_t_t_e_r. One
       can take advantage of this fact to create an unlimited number of  plot-
       files simply by renaming the output files before running more profiles.
       This may not always be the case, but it is at the time of this writing.


       Useful enhancements to _d_._p_r_o_f_i_l_e would include:

              Adding an option to display profiles using category colors, like
              a bar-chart.

              Allowing profile lines to be defined by a series of points,  not
              just two.

              Allowing  profiles  to  be saved in a file, for later viewing by
              GRASS.

              Allowing the user to enter profile line points by typing coordi-
              nates.
