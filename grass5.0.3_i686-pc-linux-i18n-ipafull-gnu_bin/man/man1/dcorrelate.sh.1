       _d_c_o_r_r_e_l_a_t_e_._s_h is a C-shell (csh(1)) script  that  graphically  displays
       the  results  of  an  _r_._s_t_a_t_s run on two raster map layers.  This shell
       script is useful for highlighting the correlation (or lack of it) among
       data layers (scattergram).


       The  results  are  displayed  in the active display frame on the user's
       graphics monitor.  _d_c_o_r_r_e_l_a_t_e_._s_h erases the active  frame  before  dis-
       playing results.

              The  names  of from two to four existing raster map layers to be
              included in the correlation.

       This is a shell script that uses _r_._s_t_a_t_s and the UNIX  _a_w_k  command  to
       calculate  the  correlation  among  data  layers,  and  uses _d_._t_e_x_t and
       _d_._g_r_a_p_h to display the results.


       If three or four map layers are specified, the correlation  among  each
       combination of two data layers is displayed.


       This  command  is written for _/_b_i_n_/_c_s_h.  If your system doesn't support
       this shell, don't install this script.

       This program is simply a shell script.  Users are  encouraged  to  make
       their  own  shell  script programs using similar techniques.  See $GIS-
       BASE/scripts/dcorrelate.sh.
