       _r_._n_e_i_g_h_b_o_r_s looks at each cell in a raster input file, and examines the
       values assigned to the cells in some user-defined "neighborhood" around
       it.  It outputs a new raster map layer in which each cell is assigned a
       value  that  is  some  (user-specified)  function of the values in that
       cell's neighborhood.  For example, each cell in the output layer  might
       be assigned a value equal to the average of the values appearing in its
       3 x 3 cell "neighborhood" in the input layer.


       The program will be run non-interactively if the user specifies program
       arguments (see OPTIONS) on the command line.  Alternately, the user can
       simply type rr..nneeiigghhbboorrss on the command line, without program arguments.
       In this case, the user will be prompted for flag settings and parameter
       values.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       The user must specify the names of the raster map layers to be used for
       _i_n_p_u_t and _o_u_t_p_u_t, the _m_e_t_h_o_d used to analyze neighborhood values (i.e.,
       the neighborhood function or operation to be performed), and  the  _s_i_z_e
       of  the  neighborhood.  Optionally, the user can also specify the _T_I_T_L_E
       to be assigned to the raster map layer _o_u_t_p_u_t, elect to not  align  the
       resolution  of  the  output with that of the input (the _-_a option), and
       elect to run _r_._n_e_i_g_h_b_o_r_s quietly (the _-_q option).   These  options  are
       described further below.

       what new value a center cell in a neighborhood will have after  examin-
       ing  values  inside  its  neighboring cells.  Each cell in a raster map
       layer becomes the center cell of a  neighborhood  as  the  neighborhood
       window  moves  from cell to cell throughout the map layer.  _r_._n_e_i_g_h_b_o_r_s
       can perform the following operations:



       aavveerraaggee
              The average value within the  neighborhood.   In  the  following
              example, the result would be:
              (7*4 + 6 + 5 + 4*3)/9 = 5.66
              The result is rounded to the nearest integer (in this case 6).

       mmeeddiiaann The  value  found  half-way through a list of the neighborhood's
              values, when these are ranged in numerical order.

       mmooddee   The most frequently occurring value in the neighborhood.

       mmiinniimmuumm
              The minimum value within the neighborhood.

       mmaaxxiimmuumm
              The maximum value within the neighborhood.

              The number of different values within the neighborhood.  In  the

              values assigned to the center cell in the neighborhood, plus  1.
              In the above example, the interspersion is:
              5/8 * 100 + 1 = 63.5

       --aa     If  specified,  _r_._n_e_i_g_h_b_o_r_s will not align the output raster map
              layer with that of the input raster map layer.  The  _r_._n_e_i_g_h_b_o_r_s
              program  works  in  the current geographic region.  It is recom-
              mended, but not required, that the resolution of the  geographic
              region be the same as that of the raster map layer.  By default,
              if unspecified, _r_._n_e_i_g_h_b_o_r_s will align these  geographic  region
              settings.

       --qq     If  specified,  _r_._n_e_i_g_h_b_o_r_s  will  run relatively quietly (i.e.,
              without printing to  standard  output  notes  on  the  program's
              progress).   If  unspecified, the program will print messages to
              standard output by default.


NNOOTTEESS
       The _r_._n_e_i_g_h_b_o_r_s program works in the current geographic region with the
       current  mask,  if  any.  It is recommended, but not required, that the
       resolution of the geographic region be the same as that of  the  raster
       map  layer.  By default, _r_._n_e_i_g_h_b_o_r_s will align these geographic region
       settings.  However, the user can elect to keep original input and  out-
       put  resolutions  which are not aligned by specifying this (e.g., using
       the _-_a option).


       _r_._n_e_i_g_h_b_o_r_s copies the GRASS _c_o_l_o_r  files  associated  with  the  input
       raster  map  layer  for  those  output map layers that are based on the
       neighborhood average, median,  mode,  minimum,  and  maximum.   Because
       standard deviation, variance, diversity, and interspersion are indices,
       rather than direct correspondents to input values, no _c_o_l_o_r  files  are
       copied  for  these map layers.  (The user should note that although the
       _c_o_l_o_r file is copied for _a_v_e_r_a_g_ed neighborhood function output, whether
       or  not  the color file makes sense for the output will be dependent on
       the input data values.)
