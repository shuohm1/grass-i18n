       _d_._a_s_k is designed for shell scripts that need to prompt  the  user  for
       the  name of a data base file in the user's current GRASS mapset search
       path.  After _d_._a_s_k is invoked with needed parameters, the mouse becomes
       active  and  a  menu  containing files of the specified _e_l_e_m_e_n_t type is
       displayed on the user's graphics monitor.  The user is prompted by  the
       prompt "_m_e_s_s_a_g_e" to select one of the listed file names with the mouse.
       Specifically, the query that appears to the user takes the form:


       DDoouubbllee click on the _p_r_o_m_p_t "message" DDoouubbllee click here to cancel


       (A list of files of the specified _e_l_e_m_e_n_t type from each of the mapsets
       listed in the user's mapset search path is also displayed.)



       After  the  user  responds,  the mouse is deactivated and the displayed
       menu is erased from the screen (leaving  any  underlying  materials  on
       display  intact).   Three  lines  are  written  to standard output (the
       user's terminal screen):

              Name of a GRASS data  base  element,  followed  by  a  one  word
              description  of the element. GRASS data base elements are mapset
              subdirectories; these  include:  bdlg,  cats,  cell,  cell_misc,
              cellhd,   colr,   colr2,   dig,  dig_ascii,  dig_att,  dig_cats,
              dig_plus, dlg, group, hist, icons, noise, paint, site_lists, and
              windows.   The _d_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n will be used to display an error mes-
              sage to the screen if no files of the named element  type  exist
              in  the  user's  mapset  search path.  The prompt "_m_e_s_s_a_g_e" will
              appear in the pop-up menu displayed on the user's graphics moni-
              tor.  The files listed in the menu will be of the specified _e_l_e_-
              _m_e_n_t type, and exist in mapsets listed  in  the  user's  current
              mapset search path.

              A  brief  message with which the user will be prompted.  If this
              message contains more than  one  word,  it  should  be  enclosed
              within  double quotes ("").  It is a non-selectable message dis-
              played in the menu bar of a pop-up menu.   Selectable  items  in
              the  displayed menu include a cancel option and any of the files
              in the mapset subdirectory _n_a_m_e  in  the  user's  mapset  search
              path.

       Given the following input,


       dd..aasskk eelleemmeenntt==cell,raster pprroommpptt=="raster map layer to be used"



       _d_._a_s_k  will  prompt  the user to select a raster (cell) file from among
       those listed in the "cell" directories of the  mapsets  listed  in  his
       current  mapset  search  path.  A  pop-up menu will be displayed on the
       user's graphics monitor, containing the prompt:


       DDoouubbllee click on the _r_a_s_t_e_r map layer to be used DDoouubbllee  click  here  to
       cancel


OOUUTTPPUUTT
       If  the  user selects a file name from the displayed menu, _d_._a_s_k writes
       three lines to standard output:


       nnaammee==_f_i_l_e___n_a_m_e mmaappsseett==_m_a_p_s_e_t___n_a_m_e ffuullllnnaammee==_f_i_l_e___n_a_m_e_@_m_a_p_s_e_t___n_a_m_e



       The output is in the form of /bin/sh commands to set the variable  _n_a_m_e
       to  the  file name specified by the user (of the _e_l_e_m_e_n_t type requested
       by _d_._a_s_k), _m_a_p_s_e_t to the GRASS mapset in which this file  resides,  and
       _f_u_l_l_n_a_m_e to the name of the file and its mapset.


       If the user elects not to select a file but instead chooses the "Double
       click here to cancel" option, the mouse  will  be  deactivated  and  no
       variable assignments will be returned to standard output.


       If  no files of the specified _e_l_e_m_e_n_t type are found in the user's cur-
       rent mapset search path, the mouse is activated and the following  mes-
       sage is displayed on the user's graphics monitor:


       NNoo _e_l_e_m_e_n_t description files found CClliicckk hheerree ttoo ccoonnttiinnuuee

       cannot be supplied to _d_._a_s_k interactively; they must be supplied on the
       command line or from a file.

       This  program  calls  other GRASS programs which may generate confusing
       error messages. Example: an error message from the program d.menu  will
       appear if a nonexistent map element is chosen.
