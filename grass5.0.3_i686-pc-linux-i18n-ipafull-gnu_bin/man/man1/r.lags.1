       rr..llaaggss  - GRASS module to calculate various spatial dependence measures
       for all possible lags within a given image. Each  measure  is  made  by
       comparing  two  cells only for each lag azimuth and distance. The whole
       image is read once for each cell in the image, therefore is very compu-
       tationally  expensive.  A Sparc 2 would typically take 1 hour to calcu-
       late a 150x150 image.

       V1.0 written 17.6.92 to calculate Moran autocorrelation statistic.

       V2.0 written 18.7.92 to also calulate Haralick's grey-tone spatial
       dependence textural measures.

       V2.1 modified 18.9.95 to conform to standard GRASS program structure.


       Future improvements could include (i) Option of faster,  memory  inten-
       sive
       option;  (ii)  Further  lag  dependent  measures; (iii) Cumulative lags
       under
       some distance weighting function.  (iv)  Option  of  ignoring/including
       zero
       values in the calculation.
