       The  _i_._s_m_a_p  program  is  used  to segment multispectral images using a
       spectral class model known as a Gaussian mixture  distribution.   Since
       Gaussian  mixture distributions include conventional multivariate Gaus-
       sian distributions, this program may also be used to segment multispec-
       tral images based on simple spectral mean and covariance parameters.


       _i_._s_m_a_p  has  two  modes of operation.  The first mode is the sequential
       maximum a posteriori (SMAP) mode [2].  The SMAP segmentation  algorithm
       attempts  to improve segmentation accuracy by segmenting the image into
       regions rather than segmenting each pixel separately (see NOTES).


       The second mode is the more conventional maximum likelihood (ML)  clas-
       sification  which  classifies each pixel separately, but requires some-
       what less computation. This mode is selected  with  the  --mm  flag  (see
       below).

       --mm     Use  maximum  likelihood  estimation  (instead of smap).  Normal
              operation is to use SMAP estimation (see NOTES).

       --qq     Run quietly, without printing messages about  program  progress.
              Without  this  flag, messages will be printed (to stderr) as the
              program progresses.

              The subgroup within the group specified that specifies the  sub-
              set  of  the  band files that are to be used as image data to be
              classified.

              imagery signaturefile

              The signature file that contains the spectral signatures  (i.e.,
              the  statistics)  for the classes to be identified in the image.
              This signature file is produced by the program _i_._g_e_n_s_i_g_s_e_t  (see
              NOTES).

              size of submatrix to process at one time

              default: 128

              This  option  specifies the size of the "window" to be used when
              reading the image data.


       This program was written to be nice about memory usage  without  influ-
       encing  the  resultant  classification.  This option allows the user to
       control how much memory is used.   More  memory  may  mean  faster  (or
       slower)  operation  depending  on how much real memory your machine has
       and how much virtual memory the program uses.


       The size of the submatrix used in segmenting the image has a  principle
       function  of controlling memory usage; however, it also can have a sub-
       tle effect on the quality of the segmentation in the  smap  mode.   The
       smoothing parameters for the smap segmentation are estimated separately
       for each submatrix.  Therefore, if the image has regions with  qualita-
       tively  different behavior, (e.g., natural woodlands and man-made agri-
       cultural fields) it may be useful to use a submatrix  small  enough  so
       that  different  smoothing  parameters may be used for each distinctive
       region of the image.


       The submatrix size has no effect on the performance of the ML segmenta-
       tion method.

              output raster map.

              The  name  of  a raster map that will contain the classification
              results.  This new raster map layer will contain categories that
              can be related to landcover categories on the ground.

       The SMAP algorithm exploits the fact that nearby pixels in an image are
       likely  to  have  the  same class.  It works by segmenting the image at
       various scales or resolutions and using the course scale  segmentations
       to  guide  the  finer scale segmentations.  In addition to reducing the
       number of misclassifications, the  SMAP  algorithm  generally  produces
       segmentations  with larger connected regions of a fixed class which may
       be useful in some applications.


       The amount of smoothing that is performed in the segmentation is depen-
       dent  of  the  behavior of the data in the image.  If the data suggests
       that the nearby pixels often change  class,  then  the  algorithm  will
       adaptively  reduce  the  amount of smoothing.  This ensures that exces-
       sively large regions are not formed.
