       This program produces a MOSS vector file containing GRASS  site,  line,
       or  area  features  that  have been converted into MOSS point, line, or
       polygon features, respectively.  Only one type of data (site, line,  or
       area)  can  be  converted  at  a time.  Site data can be extracted from
       GRASS _s_i_t_e _l_i_s_t_s files or _v_e_c_t_o_r files, at the user's discretion.   The
       resultant  MOSS  files  will be created in the _m_o_s_s subdirectory of the
       current mapset.


       The user will be prompted for the GRASS data type, the name of the _s_i_t_e
       _l_i_s_t_s or _v_e_c_t_o_r file to be converted, and the name of the the MOSS vec-
       tor file to be created.  If line data is being converted, the user will
       be  asked  whether area edges should be processed as lines.  If so, the
       line features produced from the area edges  will  not  have  attributes
       associated with them.


       Upon successful completion of the data export, the number of items con-
       verted will be printed, and the user will be given the option  of  pro-
       cessing another GRASS file.

NNOOTTEESS
       Vector  data cannot be exported until the necessary GRASS support files
       have been built.


       This program is interactive and requires no command line arguments.
