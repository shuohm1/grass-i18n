OOVVEERRVVIIEEWW
       rr..wwaatteerr..ffeeaa is an interactive program that allows the user to  simulate
       storm  water  runoff  analysis using the finite element numerical tech-
       nique.  Infiltration is calculated using the Green  and  Ampt  formula-
       tion.  rr..wwaatteerr..ffeeaa  computes  and  draws hydrographs for every basin as
       well as at stream junctions in an analysis area. It also  draws  anima-
       tion maps at the basin level.

       The maps required by rr..wwaatteerr..ffeeaa  are:


       1) Basin map
       2) Stream map
       3) Drainage map
       4) Accumulation map
       5) Slope map


       The other data requirements of rr..wwaatteerr..ffeeaa are the parameters needed to
       calculate infiltration  and  the  channel  roughness  parameter.  Model
       parameters may be provided either in the form of maps or as values:


       1) Manning roughness coefficient map or basin value
       2) Saturated hydraulic conductivity map or basin value
       3) Suction head at wetting front map or basin value
       4) Effective porosity map or basin value
       5) Degree of saturation basin value

       On  running rr..wwaatteerr..ffeeaa for the first time, the directory _"_r_._w_a_t_e_r_._f_e_a_"
       is created under $LOCATION. When the user runs rr..wwaatteerr..ffeeaa, the program
       will  prompt  the user for the project name. The project name refers to
       the directory that is created under the  _"_r_._w_a_t_e_r_._f_e_a_"  directory.  All
       files (not maps) related to the analysis carried out by rr..wwaatteerr..ffeeaa are
       stored under this directory. If the project does  not  exist  then  the
       user  is  further  requested for the input maps. If the project already
       exists, then the program looks for the proper project related files  to
       proceed with stopped work.

       The  user is  asked for the following  configuration modes: I) Rainfall
       mode: The rainfall mode is defined as follows:


       1 = spatially uniform and constant in time
       2 = spatially uniform but varying in time


       If the user decides to use mode 2, then  a  mechanism  is  provided  to
       allow creation of a rainfall rate file (described in step 4).


       II) Basin-level hydrographs: This configuration mode allows the user to
       view intermediate hydrographs for every basin. The hydrographs will  be
       displayed on the graphics monitor. Each basin is considered to be inde-
       pendent of every other basin in the analysis area.


       III) Basin-level animation maps: This  configuration  mode  allows  the
       user  to  create time-series maps for later animation of flow depth for
       all the basins that have been analyzed. All animation maps use a multi-
       plication  factor of 1000.  The map cell value divided by the multipli-
       cation factor yields the actual value of flow depth in meters. The user
       will  require enough file space in the GRASS database for this configu-
       ration. All animation map names have the following naming scheme:


       fea..#


       Here '#' represents the time step. One time step refers  to  1/40th  of
       the  total monitoring time. Twenty maps are created at every other time
       step.


       PPrrooggrraamm ffllooww


       The basin and stream maps are displayed on the monitor  when  the  user
       starts working on a project. The entire analysis is divided into a num-
       ber of steps.  The user is presented with a menu to proceed through the
       set  of  steps to facilitate easy changes to the simulation for a given
       analysis area or to stop analysis between menu steps and continue at  a
       more convenient time.


       The main menu is shown below:




       Choose from the menu:




       *   1. Process steps without breaks.
       *->  2. Select basins for simulation.
       X   3. Extract topographical data.
       X   4. Select hydraulic parameters and simulation time.
       X   5. Basin simulation.
       X   6. Simulate any particular basin.
       X   7. Channel routing of basin hydrographs.
       *   8. Stop.




       You are starting from the beginning.


       Choice:


       The "X", "*", and "*->" above have the following meaning.



       * 8    The user can select this part from the menu.

       *-> 8  This  is  the step that the user must select in order to proceed
              in a sequence.

       X 8    The user can not select these parts of the menu (until  previous
              steps have been executed).




       Throughout  the  program the symbols described above change as the user
       moves from step to step.  The message just above the Choice prompt sig-
       nals  the  status of the program, and guides the user as to what should
       be the next step.





        This  part of the menu will not prompt for steps 2-5, 7 and will carry
        out  all  the analysis. The user will find it advantageous to use this
        step when analyzing a small area or a few basins.



         This part of the menu draws the basin and stream maps for the user to
         select the area of analysis. The mouse is then activated to provide a
         point and click environment for the user to select basins in the area
         of analysis. Upon successfully selecting the basins the user is given
         the choice of deleting basins  from  the  selected  area.  The  basin
         topology  is  then  determined and information on basin statistics is
         gathered. The information on connectivity between basins is stored in
         the  _"_i_n_p_u_t_._b_a_s_i_n_"  file  and  the information on basin statistics is
         stored in the _"_b_a_s_i_n___i_n_f_o_" file.  Two  reclass  maps  describing  the
         analysis  area  are  also created. The maps have the following naming
         scheme:


       _"_f_e_a_._s_t_r_e_a_m_._"
       _"_f_e_a_._b_a_s_i_n_._"


       The user should avoid using these names  to  create  other  maps.  Once
       these  maps  are  created the user should not destroy them, if the user
       wishes to continue working on the project.



          This part of the menu generates information about  the  connectivity
          between cells and boundary conditions. This information is stored in
          the _"_i_n_p_u_t_._f_i_l_e_" file in the project directory.   If  the  animation
          configuration has been set then another file called _"_c_o_o_r_d_i_n_a_t_e_s_" is
          created in the project directory. This file contains information  on
          the coordinates of every cell in the analysis area.





           This  part  of  the  menu  carries  out  two  tasks. The first task
           involves querying the user for simulation parameters.  The  simula-
           tion  parameters  include  duration of rainfall, maximum intensity,
           time step for simulation, monitoring time and names  of  simulation
           maps if any. The second task involves querying channel characteris-
           tics assuming the channels as trapezoidal cross-sections.  The user
           is required to provide channel side slope, channel bottom width and
           the channel roughness coefficient values for every stream category.


       The program creates a file _"_t_i_m_e_d_a_t_a_" in the project directory to store
       information from this part of the menu. If the user  has  selected  the
       "Spatially uniform and time varying rainfall" mode (mode = 2), then the
       user is queried for the the name of a time file. If the file  does  not
       exist then a screen like the one shown below appears:

       It  is  important to note  that the values in the time column should be
       in an increasing order. It is also not necessary to fill all  the  rows
       and  the  user  can  stop  after filling only a few rows. The number of
       lines are limited to fifteen. If more than fifteen lines  are  required
       then  the  user  will  have to create the file using an editor. In that
       case the user should just type the time since commencement of  rainfall
       (minutes)  in  the  first  column  followed  by  the rainfall intensity
       (cm/hr) in the second column as shown below:

            This part of the menu carries out the simulation for each basin in
            the  area  of  analysis. Every basin is analyzed as independent of
            every other basin.  The user is shown the independent basin hydro-
            graph   for   every  basin  on  the  graphics  monitor.  The  file
            _"_d_i_s_c_h_._b_a_s_i_n_" is created  towards the end of simulation of all the
            basins.  This  file contains  columns of discharge for each basin.
            The column number corresponds to the basin category value  in  the
            legend. If the animation configuration mode was set then a file is
            created in the project directory called _"_d_i_s_c_h___f_i_l_e_"_.   This  file
            holds  basin discharge values at every point in every basin of the
            analysis area.



             This part of the menu provides the  facility  of  changing  basin
             characteristics  such  as  the  Manning roughness coefficient and
             other infiltration parameters.  This  choice  can  be  used  only
             after  the  successful  completion  of choice 5.  If the user has
             provided maps for the parameters  then  the  user  should  select
             "stop"  from  the menu to make changes to the parameter maps pro-
             vided to the model.



              This part of the menu connects the basins that  were  considered
              independent  in  the  previous  step. Routing of the basin-level
              hydrographs is done based on the  connectivity  between  basins.
              This  can  generate hydrographs only for seven stream junctions.
              If there are more than seven stream  junctions  then  the  first
              seven  stream  junction  hydrographs  are  shown. The process of
              drawing individual basin animation maps follows the  drawing  of
              the  hydrographs  at  stream  junctions.   After completing this
              choice a file _"_d_i_s_c_h_._j_u_n_c_t_i_o_n_" is created.  This  file  contains
              discharge values at different steps for every stream junction.



               This  part  of  the  menu  is available to the user at any time
               between the different choices described in the menu  and  exits
               the user out of the program.

       1.)  Negative values of drainage direction inside basins maps cannot be
       accepted. Negative values are  generated  as  a  result  of  incomplete
       information  regarding  the  basin  drainage pattern (e.g., rr..wwaatteerrsshheedd
       produces negative values as a result of outflowing drainage basins).


       2.) The drainage map should route the water and not form  pits,  lakes,
       or  ponds.  Note that this does not imply that the DEM by itself should
       not have any pits.


       3) Interstorm modeling, interflow, or baseflow are not considered.


       4) Backwater effects are not considered.


       5) The kinematic wave analogy is appropriate  where  the  land  surface
       slope and channel slope are large. This may not be true in flat, marshy
       terrain and in slow, meandering river channels.

       1. rr..wwaatteerr..ffeeaa alters the region in the _W_I_N_D file. This is done by mak-
       ing a systems call to:


       g.region align=name


       just when the program rr..wwaatteerr..ffeeaa is run.


       2. A small watershed can be  analyzed  by  providing  values  of  model
       parameters.   However  it  is advisble to provide maps of various model
       parameters if there are many basins in the watershed.   In  the  former
       case  the  value  provided by the user shall be constant for the entire
       basin for which the value is queried. The user shall create the  infil-
       tration maps using the following set of rules. The map value divided by
       the multiplication factor yields the  actual  value  in  the  described
       units:



       center tab(:);
       ll
       lc.
       Parameter:Multiplication factor





       Soil saturated hydraulic
       conductivity map (meters/sec):10,000,000





       Manning roughness coefficient:1000





       Soil suction at wetting front (m):1000





       Soil porosity map (m3/m3):1000






       3.  If the user has provided a slope map that has zero slope value any-
       where in the map, then a slope value of 5% is assumed for that cell.


       4. It is preferred that none of the basins in  the  analysis  area  has
       more than 750 cells, as this will increase the computation time drasti-
       cally.  The number of cells in a basin can be controlled by setting the
       threshold value to small values when running rr..wwaatteerrsshheedd.


       5.  Using larger cells can speed up the analysis process significantly.
       It is important to note that rr..wwaatteerrsshheedd should be run for the  resolu-
       tion at which the user desires to run the rr..wwaatteerr..ffeeaa analysis.
