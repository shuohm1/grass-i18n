       The GRASS program _r_._s_u_p_p_o_r_t allows the user  to  create  and/or  modify
       raster  map layer support files.  It may be run only on raster map lay-
       ers in the user's current mapset.

        Most options have to be used interactively, so the user runs the  pro-
       gram by typing rr..ssuuppppoorrtt, and will be queried for inputs.


       Various  GRASS  programs  depend  on one or more of the following GRASS
       _s_u_p_p_o_r_t files:

       cceellllhhdd The cell header file contains information on a map's projection,
              zone,  regional  boundaries, row and column totals, cell resolu-
              tion, storage format, and compression.  It describes  where  and
              how  this  map's  raster  (cell)  data fits in with reference to
              other raster map layers' data.  Without it, the raster map layer
              could  not  be displayed or analyzed properly.  Using _r_._s_u_p_p_o_r_t,
              the user can change the # of columns, # of bytes per  cell,  and
              default  geographic region settings.  Generally, users would not
              change this information.  Cell header files are stored under the
              _c_e_l_l_h_d directory under the user's current mapset.

       ssttaattss  Raster map layer statistics are saved in the form of a histogram
              and range of the category values which occur in the  map  layer.
              Statistics  files  are stored in subdirectories of the _c_e_l_l___m_i_s_c
              directory under the user's current mapset.  This option is (cur-
              rently)  the  only  option which can be used on command line (-r
              flag).

       ccaattss   A category file associates each category value in the raster map
              layer  with a category description (label).  The user may add or
              edit the category descriptions, alter the number of  categories,
              and  add  or  alter  the map's TITLE.  Category files associated
              with raster map layers are stored under the  _c_a_t_s  directory  in
              the user's current mapset.

       ccoollrr   A  color  file  associates each category value in the raster map
              layer with a color.  Using _r_._s_u_p_p_o_r_t, the user may assign one of
              eight  color table types to the raster map layer.  Map color ta-
              ble files are stored under the _c_o_l_r and _c_o_l_r_2 directories  under
              the user's current mapset.

       hhiisstt   Historical information about the raster map layer is stored in a
              history file.  The user may add or edit the raster map's  TITLE,
              data  type, data source, data description, and include comments.
              (Note that the specification of map data type here  is  somewhat
              archaic, and should always be set to _r_a_s_t_e_r.)  Map history files
              are stored under the _h_i_s_t directory  under  the  user's  current
              mapset.


NNOOTTEESS
       The  _r_._s_u_p_p_o_r_t  program  attempts to verify that the information in the
       cell header is reasonable. The data format specified in the  header  is
       verified  against  the  raster map layer itself. This includes checking
       that files which the header indicates are _c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s_e_d  are  really  com-
       pressed,  and  that  the  number  of  rows and columns specified in the
       header correspond to the actual file size.


       The _r_._s_u_p_p_o_r_t program can also be  used  to  determine  the  number  of
       columns  and  rows  of data in a raster map layer, in the event that no
       cell header is available.  This is useful, for example,  for  importing
       raster map layers created by software other than GRASS.


       If  the  file is not compressed, the file size should be the product of
       the number of rows and columns.  If the file is compressed,  this  test
       cannot  be  performed  since the file size will bear no relation to the
       product. The number of rows can still be verified, but  the  number  of
       columns cannot.


       To compute or correct the _s_t_a_t_s, the cell header must be correct, since
       the raster map layer is read to determine the stats.


       If a new _c_a_t_s or _c_o_l_r (or _c_o_l_r_2) file is required, the  _s_t_a_t_s  must  be
       correct.


       The user is allowed to change the number of categories specified in the
       category file. This should oonnllyy be done if the user knows that the max-
       imum  category  value  in  the  raster map layer is different than that
       which is recorded in the category file.  Changing the category value in
       the _c_a_t_s file allows the user to add more category labels, or to remove
       labels. It does NOT change the category values in the raster map  layer
       itself.


       The color file is unique among GRASS support files.  While it is neces-
       sary to protect a user's original data from  being  modified  by  users
       working  under  other  mapsets,  these  users need to be able to create
       color tables for maps that are stored under mapsets  other  than  their
       own.  Color table files meet both these objectives.


       Color  table files get stored in one of two directories, both under the
       user's current mapset. The color files created by  a  user  for  raster
       maps  stored  under that user's current mapset get stored in the direc-
       tory _$_L_O_C_A_T_I_O_N_/_c_o_l_r and cannot be modified or removed by  other  users.
       The  color  table  files  that the user modifies/creates for raster map
       layers _n_o_t stored under the user's current mapset get stored in a  _s_e_c_-
       _o_n_d_a_r_y  _c_o_l_o_r file under the user's mapset.  This secondary color table
       is stored under $LOCATION/colr2/ where  is the name of the mapset under
       which  the  raster  map data are stored.  In versions of GRASS prior to
       3.0, this was also the case for color tables in the user's own  mapset.
       Now, however, if a user modifies a color table associated with a raster
       map layer in his own current mapset, these changes will be made to  the
       user's  original  color file (i.e., the user's color changes will over-
       write whatever previous color table file existed for this map under the
       user's $LOCATION/colr directory).  No secondary color files are created
       for raster map layers stored in the user's own mapset.

       In order to modify the _c_e_l_l _h_e_a_d_e_r, the raster (cell) map  layer  under
       consideration  must  _n_o_t be a _r_e_c_l_a_s_s file. This is because the _r_e_c_l_a_s_s
       file's header does not contain positional  information,  but  rather  a
       reference  to  another  raster  map layer. Thus it shares a cell header
       with the referenced raster map layer.  In  order  to  change  the  cell
       header, _r_._s_u_p_p_o_r_t must be run on the true raster file referenced.
