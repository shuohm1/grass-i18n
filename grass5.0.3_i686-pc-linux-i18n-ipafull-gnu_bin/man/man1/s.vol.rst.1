       _s_._v_o_l_._r_s_t interpolates the values to 3-dimensional grid from point data
       (climatic  stations,  drill  holes etc.) given in a 3D sites file named
       _i_n_p_u_t.  Output g3d file is _e_l_e_v. The 3-dimensional grid is given by the
       current  3D  region.  If  the options _c_e_l_l_i_n_p and _c_e_l_l_o_u_t are specified
       then the output raster file _c_e_l_l_o_u_t contains  crossection  of  interpo-
       lated  volume  with surface defined by input cell file .  As an option,
       simultaneously with interpolation, geometric  parameters  magnitude  of
       gradient,  both aspects, change of gradient, Gauss-Kronecker curvature,
       or mean curvature are computed and saved as g3d file  as  specified  by
       the  options  _g_r_a_d_i_e_n_t_,  _a_s_p_e_c_t_1_,  _a_s_p_e_c_t_2_, _n_c_u_r_v_, _g_c_u_r_v_, _m_c_u_r_v respec-
       tively.

       At first, data points are checked for identical points and points  that
       are  closer to each other than given _d_m_i_n are removed. Parameters _w_m_u_l_t
       and _z_m_u_l_t allow user to re-scale the w-values and  z-values  for  sites
       (useful  e.g. for transformation of elevations given in feet to meters,
       so  that the proper values of gradient and curvatures can be computed).

       Regularized spline with tension is used for the interpolation. The _t_e_n_-
       _s_i_o_n parameter tunes the character of the resulting  volume  from  thin
       plate  to membrane. Higher values of tension parameter reduce the over-
       shoots that can  appear in volumes with rapid change of  gradient.  For
       noisy  data,  it  is possible  to define a smoothing parameter, _s_m_o_o_t_h.
       With the smoothing parameter  set to zero (_s_m_o_o_t_h_=_0) the resulting vol-
       ume passes exactly through  the data points. When smoothing is used, it
       is  possible to output site file  _d_e_v_i  containing  deviations  of  the
       resulting volume from the given data.

       User can define a 2D raster file named _m_a_s_k_m_a_p, which will be used as a
       mask. The  interpolation  is  skipped  for  3-dimensional  cells  whose
       2-dimensional  projection  has  zero value in mask. Zero values will be
       assigned to these cells in all output g3d files.

       If the number of given points is greater than 700, segmented processing
       is  used.  The  region is split into 3-dimensional "box" segments, each
       having less than _s_e_g_m_a_x points and interpolation is performed  on  each
       segment  of the region. To ensure the smooth connection of segments the
       interpolation function for each segment is computed using the points in
       given  segment  and  the points in its neighborhood. The minimum number
       of points taken for interpolation  is controlled by _n_p_m_i_n ,  the  value
       of  which  must be larger than _s_e_g_m_a_x  and less than 700. This limit of
       700 was selected to ensure the numerical  stability and  efficiency  of
       the algorithm.

       _s_._v_o_l_._r_s_t  uses  regularized spline with tension for interpolation from
       point data (as described in Mitasova and Mitas, 1993). The  implementa-
       tion  has  an  improved segmentation procedure based on Oct-trees which
       enhances the efficiency for large data sets.

       Geometric parameters - magnitude  of  gradient  (_g_r_a_d_i_e_n_t),  horizontal
       (_a_s_p_e_c_t_1)  and  vertical (_a_s_p_e_c_t_2_) aspects, change of gradient (_n_c_u_r_v),
       Gauss-Kronecker  (_g_c_u_r_v)  and  mean  curvatures  (_m_c_u_r_v)  are  computed
       directly  from  the  interpolation function so that the important rela-
       tionships between these parameters are preserved. More  information  on
       these parameters can be found in Mitasova et al., 1995 or Thorpe, 1979.

       The program gives warning when significant overshoots appear and higher
       tension  should  be  used. However, with tension too high the resulting
       volume changes its behavior to membrane( rubber  sheet  stretched  over
       the  data points resulting in a peak in each given point and everywhere
       else the volume  goes  rapidly  to  trend).  With  smoothing  parameter
       greater  than zero the volume will not pass through the data points and
       the higher the parameter the closer the volume will be  to  the  trend.
       For  theory  on  smoothing  with  splines  see Talmi and Gilat, 1977 or
       Wahba, 1990.

       If a visible connection of segments  appears,  the  program  should  be
       rerun  with  higher  _n_p_m_i_n  to get more points from the neighborhood of
       given segment.

       If the number of points in a site file is less then 400, _s_e_g_m_a_x  should
       be set to 400 so that segmentation is not performed when it is not nec-
       essary.

       The program gives warning when user wants to  interpolate  outside  the
       "box"  given by minimum and maximum coordinates in site file, zoom into
       the area where the points are is suggested in this case.

       For large data sets (thousands of data points) it is suggested to  zoom
       into a smaller representative area and test whether the parameters cho-
       sen (e.g. defaults) are appropriate.

       The user must run _g_3_._r_e_g_i_o_n before the program to set  the  region  for
       interpolation.
