       _r_._w_a_t_e_r_s_h_e_d  generates  a  set  of  maps indicating: 1) the location of
       watershed basins, and 2) the LS and S factors of the Revised  Universal
       Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE).


       _r_._w_a_t_e_r_s_h_e_d  can  be run either interactively or non-interactively.  If
       the user types


       rr..wwaatteerrsshheedd



       on the command line without program arguments, the program will  prompt
       the user with a verbose description of the input maps.  The interactive
       version of
        can prepare inputs to lumped-parameter  hydrologic  models.   After  a
       verbose  interactive  session,  will query the user for a number of map
       layers.  Each map layer's values will be tabulated by  watershed  basin
       and sent to an output file.  This output file is organized to ease data
       entry into a lumped-parameter hydrologic model program.  The non-inter-
       active version of
        cannot create this file.


       The user can run the program non-interactively, by specifying input map
       names on the command line.  Parameter names may be specified  by  their
       full  names,  or by any initial string that distinguish them from other
       parameter names.  In 's case, the first two letters of each name suffi-
       ciently  distinguishes  parameter  names.  For example, the two expres-
       sions below are equivalent inputs to :

       _-_m     Without this flag set, the entire  analysis  is  run  in  memory
              maintained  by  the operating system.  This can be limiting, but
              is relatively fast.  Setting the flag causes the program to man-
              age  memory on disk which allows larger maps to be processes but
              is considerably slower.

       _-_4     Allow only horizontal and vertical flow of  water.   Stream  and
              slope lengths are approximately the same as outputs from default
              surface flow (allows horizontal, vertical, and diagonal flow  of
              water).   This flag will also make the drainage basins look more
              homogeneous.

       _e_l_e_v_a_t_i_o_n
              Input map: Elevation on which entire analysis is based.

       _d_e_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n
              Input map:  Map layer of actual  depressions  in  the  landscape
              that  are  large  enough to slow and store surface runoff from a
              storm event.  Any non-zero values indicate depressions.

       _f_l_o_w   Input map: amount of overland flow per cell.  This map indicates
              the amount of overland flow units that each cell will contribute
              to the watershed basin model.  Overland flow units represent the
              amount  of  overland flow each cell contributes to surface flow.
              If omitted, a value of one (1) is assumed. The algorithm  is  D8
              flowaccumulation.

       _d_i_s_t_u_r_b_e_d_._l_a_n_d
              Raster  map  input layer or value containing the percent of dis-
              turbed land (i.e., croplands, and construction sites) where  the
              raster  or  input value of 17 equals 17%.  If no map or value is
              given, assumes no disturbed land.  This input is  used  for  the
              RUSLE calculations.

       _b_l_o_c_k_i_n_g
              Input  map: terrain that will block overland surface flow.  Ter-
              rain that will block overland surface flow and restart the slope
              length  for  the  RUSLE.   Any non-zero values indicate blocking
              terrain.

       _t_h_r_e_s_h_o_l_d
              The minimum size of an exterior watershed  basin  in  cells,  or
              overland flow units.

       _m_a_x_._s_l_o_p_e_._l_e_n_g_t_h
              Input  value  indicating  the maximum length of overland surface
              flow in meters.  If overland flow travels greater than the maxi-
              mum  length,  the program assumes the maximum length (it assumes
              that landscape characteristics not discernible  in  the  digital
              elevation  model  exist  that  maximize the slope length).  This
              input is used for the RUSLE  calculations  and  is  a  sensitive
              parameter.

       _a_c_c_u_m_u_l_a_t_i_o_n
              Output  map:  number of cells that drain through each cell.  The
              absolute value of each cell in this  output  map  layer  is  the
              amount  of  overland  flow  that traverses the cell.  This value
              will be the number of upland cells plus one if no overland  flow
              map is given.  If the overland flow map is given, the value will
              be in overland flow units.  Negative numbers indicate that those
              cells  possibly  have surface runoff from outside of the current
              geographic region.  Thus, any cells with negative values  cannot
              have  their  surface  runoff and sedimentation yields calculated
              accurately.

       _d_r_a_i_n_a_g_e
              Output map: drainage direction.  Provides the "aspect" for  each
              cell.  Multiplying positive values by 45 will give the direction
              in degrees that the surface runoff will travel from  that  cell.
              The  value  -1  indicates  that  the  cell  is a depression area
              (defined by the depression input map).   Other  negative  values
              indicate  that  surface  runoff is leaving the boundaries of the
              current geographic region.  The absolute value of these negative
              cells indicates the direction of flow.

       _b_a_s_i_n  Output  map:  Unique label for each watershed basin.  Each basin
              will be given a unique positive even integer.  Areas along edges
              may  not  be large enough to create an exterior watershed basin.
              0 values indicate that the cell is not part of a complete water-
              shed basin in the current geographic region.

       _s_t_r_e_a_m Output map: stream segments.  Values correspond to the watershed
              basin values.

       _h_a_l_f_._b_a_s_i_n
              Output map: each half-basin is given a unique value.   Watershed
              basins  are  divided  into left and right sides.  The right-hand
              side cell of the watershed basin (looking  upstream)  are  given
              even  values  corresponding  to the watershed basin values.  The
              left-hand side cells of the watershed basin are given odd values
              which are one less than the value of the watershed basin.

       _v_i_s_u_a_l Output  map:  useful  for  visual  display  of results.  Surface
              runoff accumulation with the values modified to provide for easy
              display.   All negative accumulation values are changed to zero.
              All positive values above the  basin  threshold  are  given  the
              value of the basin threshold.

       _l_e_n_g_t_h_._s_l_o_p_e
              Output  map:  slope  length and steepness (LS) factor.  Contains
              the LS factor for the  Revised  Universal  Soil  Loss  Equation.
              Equations  taken  from  _R_e_v_i_s_e_d _U_n_i_v_e_r_s_a_l _S_o_i_l _L_o_s_s _E_q_u_a_t_i_o_n _f_o_r

              is  a small number, it is multiplied by 100 for the GRASS output
              map.

       _s_l_o_p_e_._s_t_e_e_p_n_e_s_s
              Output map: slope steepness (S) factor for RUSLE.  Contains  the
              revised  S  factor  for the Universal Soil Loss Equation.  Equa-
              tions taken from article enTITLEd _R_e_v_i_s_e_d _S_l_o_p_e _S_t_e_e_p_n_e_s_s _F_a_c_t_o_r

              Since the S factor is a small number (usually less than one), it
              is multiplied by 100 for the GRASS output map layer.


NNOOTTEESS
       There  are  two versions of this program: _r_a_m and _s_e_g.  Which is run by
       depends on whether the _-_m flag is set.  _r_a_m uses virtual memory managed
       by  the operating system to store all the data structures and is faster
       than _s_e_g;  _s_e_g uses the GRASS segment library  which  manages  data  in
       disk  files.   _s_e_g  allows  other processes to operate on the same CPU,
       even when the  current  geographic  region  is  huge.   Due  to  memory
       requirements of both programs, it will be quite easy to run out of mem-
       ory.  If _r_a_m runs out of memory and the resolution size of the  current
       geographic  region cannot be increased, either more memory  needs to be
       added to the computer, or the swap space size needs  to  be  increased.
       If  _s_e_g  runs out of memory, additional disk space needs to be freed up
       for the program to run.


       _s_e_g uses the AT least-cost search algorithm to determine  the  flow  of
       water  over  the  landscape (see SEE ALSO section).  The algorithm pro-
       duces results similar to those obtained when running _r_._c_o_s_t and _r_._d_r_a_i_n
       on every cell on the map.


       In  many situations, the elevation data will be too finely detailed for
       the amount of time or memory available.  Running  will require use of a
       coarser  resolution.   To  make  the  results more closely resemble the
       finer terrain data, create a map layer containing the lowest  elevation
       values at the coarser resolution.  This is done by: 1) Setting the cur-
       rent geographic region equal to the elevation map layer, and  2)  Using
       the  _n_e_i_g_h_b_o_r_h_o_o_d command to find the lowest value for an area equal in
       size to the desired resolution.  For example, if the resolution of  the
       elevation data is 30 meters and the resolution of the geographic region
       for  will be 90 meters:  use the minimum function for a 3 by  3  neigh-
       borhood.  After going to the resolution at which  will be run,
        will be taking values from the _n_e_i_g_h_b_o_r_h_o_o_d output map layer that rep-
       resents the minimum elevation within the region of the coarser cell.


       The minimum size of drainage basins is only relevant for  those  basins
       that  have  no  basins  draining  into  them  (they are called exterior
       basins).  An interior drainage basin has the area that  flows  into  an
       interior  stream segment.  Thus, interior drainage basins can be of any
       size.


       The  program does not require the user to have the  current  geographic
       region filled with elevation values.  Areas without elevation data MUST
       be masked out using the _r_._m_a_s_k  command.   Areas  masked  out  will  be
       treated  as  if they are off the edge of the region.  Masks will reduce
       the memory necessary to run the program.  Masking out unimportant areas
       can  significantly reduce processing time if the watersheds of interest
       occupies a small percentage of the overall area.


       Zero data values will be treated as elevation data (not  no_data).   If
       there  are  zero  data along the edges of the current region, that edge
       will not be able to propagate negative accumulation data to the rest of
       the  map.   This  might  give users a false sense of security about the
       quality of their data.  If there are incomplete data in  the  elevation
       map layer, users should mask out those areas.
