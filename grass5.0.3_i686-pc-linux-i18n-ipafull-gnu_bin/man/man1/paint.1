       ppaaiinntt  - Description of hardcopy color output system for GRASS.

IINNTTRROODDUUCCTTIIOONN
       The ppaaiinntt system allows the user to produce color hardcopy maps of vec-
       tor, raster, and sites file data at any scale.  For a discussion of the
       GRASS  ppaaiinntt  functions,  see the manual entries for _p_._c_h_a_r_t, _p_._c_o_l_o_r_s,
       _p_._i_c_o_n_s, _p_._l_a_b_e_l_s, _p_._m_a_p, and _p_._s_e_l_e_c_t.

       The GRASS paint system supports multiple color printers using a  _d_e_v_i_c_e
       driver  concept.   The paint (p.)  functions listed above send graphics
       requests to device-dependent paint drivers.   These  drivers  translate
       the  application  requests  into  device-dependent  requests to produce
       hardcopy maps.

       A number of paint  drivers  have  been  distributed  with  GRASS.   The
       installation of a driver is a 2 step process.  The first involves iden-
       tifying the driver(s) which correspond to printer(s) connected to  your
       system  and  compiling those drivers.  The second involves telling each
       driver which i/o port it is to use.

              The   source   code   for   the   drivers   lives    in    $GIS-
              BASE/../src/paint/Drivers  (The  variable  GISBASE refers to the
              directory in which GRASS is installed on your system.)
              The selection and compilation of the drivers is done when  GRASS
              is compiled as a whole.

              The port configuration is handled using the UNIX _l_n command.

       Each  driver  expects  to send its output to /dev/_d_r_i_v_e_r.  For example,
       the tteekk44669955 driver expects to find a tektronix 4695 (or  4696)  printer
       on /dev/tek4695.


       Suppose  the  printer  is  actually  on /dev/tty10.  Then, a link named
       /dev/tek4695 is made to /dev/tty10: ln /dev/tty10 /dev/tek4695


NNOOTTEESS
       There are 2 drivers which do not use i/o ports.   One  is  the  pprreevviieeww
       driver,  which  sends  its  output  to the graphics screen instead of a
       hardcopy printer.  This driver is very handy and should  definitely  be
       compiled on your system.


       The  other is the nnuullll driver, which is used for debugging purposes and
       probably should not be compiled on your system.


       If you compile either of these drivers, you  shouldn't  create  a  /dev
       file for them.
