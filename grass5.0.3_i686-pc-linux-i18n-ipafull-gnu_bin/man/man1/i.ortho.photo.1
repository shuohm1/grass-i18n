       _i_._o_r_t_h_o_._p_h_o_t_o allows the user to ortho-rectify imagery group files.  An
       imagery  group  consists  of several scanned aerial photographs (raster
       files) of a common area.  Imagery groups can  be  created  or  modified
       using  the  GRASS  Image Processing Program _i_._g_r_o_u_p, or using the first
       menu option described below.  _i_._o_r_t_h_o_._p_h_o_t_o guides the user through the
       steps  required  to  ortho-rectify the raster files in a single imagery
       group.


       The first menu in _i_._o_r_t_h_o_._p_h_o_t_o provides the user  with  the  following
       options:

       Initialization Options:
              1) Select/Modify imagery group

              2) Select/Modify imagery group target

              3) Select/Modify target elevation model

              4) Select/Modify imagery group camera


       Transformation Parameter Computation:
              5) Compute image-to-photo transformation parameters

              6) Initialize exposure station parameters

              7) Compute photo-to-target transformation parameters


       Ortho-rectification Option:
              8) Ortho-rectify imagery group raster files

       RETURN to exit
              >

       To  ortho-rectify aerial images the user has to follow the menu options
       step by step. Generally the user builds a target location containing  a
       projected  DEM  and  a map reference (topo sheet or other map). Another
       xy-location will contain the aerial  photo.  The  entire  rectification
       process is started within the xy-location. First the target to the pro-
       jected location has to be set (i.target),  then  the  image  references
       (fiducial  points) will be defined. After describing the camera parame-
       ters, reference points from aerial image to the  topo  sheet  from  the
       target location will be set. The local elevation will be taken from the
       target DEM. Finally the aerial image will be rectified.


       The options to follow are described as follows:

       _1_. _S_e_l_e_c_t_/_M_o_d_i_f_y _i_m_a_g_e_r_y _g_r_o_u_p
              The current imagery group is display at the top of the  previous
              menu.   You  may  select another (new or existing) imagery group
              for the ortho-rectification program  using  option  (1).   After
              choosing  option  (1) you will be prompted for the name of a new
              or existing imagery group.  Option (1)  using  the  GRASS  Image
              Processing  Program  _i_._g_r_o_u_p,  for  creation  or modification of
              imagery groups.  For more information on imagery group  creation
              or modification please the the GRASS manual page for _i_._g_r_o_u_p.

              The target location and mapset may be selected or modified using
              option (2).  After choosing option (2) you will be prompted  for
              the  names  of  the target location and mapset, where the ortho-
              rectified raster files will reside.  The target location is also
              the  location  from which the elevation model (raster file) will
              be selected -- see option (3).  Option (2) uses the GRASS  Image
              Processing  Program  _i_._t_a_r_g_e_t,  for selection or modification of
              the imagery group target location and mapset.  For more informa-
              tion  on  imagery group selection or modification please the the
              GRASS manual page for _i_._t_a_r_g_e_t.

              Option (3) allows you to select the raster file from the  target
              location to be used as the elevation model.  The elevation model
              is required for both the computation of photo-to-target  parame-
              ters  (option  6) and for the ortho-rectification of the imagery
              group files (option 8).  The raster file select for  the  eleva-
              tion model should cover the entire area of the image group to be
              ortho-rectified.  Currently, the elevation model raster file  is
              expected to be in units of meters.  DTED and DEM files are suit-
              able for use as the elevation model in  the  ortho-rectification
              program.   After  selection  option (3) you will be prompted for
              the name of the raster file in the target location that you want
              to use as the elevation model.

              Using  option  (4)  you may select or create an camera reference
              file that will be used with the current imagery group.  A camera
              reference file contains information on the internal characteris-
              tics of the aerial camera, as well as the geometry of the  fidu-
              cial  or reseau marks.  The most important characteristic of the
              camera is its focal length.  Fiducial or reseau marks  locations
              are  required  to  compute the scanned image to photo-coordinate
              transformation  parameter  (option  5).   For  a  more  detailed
              description  of  option (4) please see the GRASS manual page for
              _p_h_o_t_o_._c_a_m_e_r_a.

              The scanned image to photo-coordinate transformation  parameters
              are  computed  using option (5).  In this interactive option you
              associate scanned reference  points  (fiducials,  reseau  marks,
              etc.)  with their known photo coordinates from the camera refer-
              ence file.  Complete documentation for this option is  available
              under the manual entry _p_h_o_t_o_._2_i_m_a_g_e.

              The  use of photo.init (menu 6) is only required when rectifying
              a tilted or oblique aerial photo.

              If option (6)  is  selected,  initial  camera  exposure  station
              parameters  and  initial  variances may be selected or modified.
              Complete documentation for this option is  available  under  the
              manual entry _p_h_o_t_o_._i_n_i_t.

              The  photo to target transformation parameters are compute using
              option(7).  Here control  points  are  marked  on  one  or  more
              imagery  group  files and associated with there known positional
              and elevation  coordinates.   Complete  documentation  for  this
              option is available under the manual entry _p_h_o_t_o_._2_t_a_r_g_e_t.

              Option  (8) is used to perform the actual image ortho-rectifica-
              tion after all of the transformation parameters have  been  com-
              puted.  Ortho-rectified raster files will be created in the tar-
              get location for each selected  imagery  group  file.   You  may
              select  either  the current window in the target location or the
              minimal bounding window for the ortho-rectified image.  Complete
              documentation  for  this  option  is  available under the manual
              entry _p_h_o_t_o_._r_e_c_t_i_f_y.

       _i_._o_r_t_h_o_._p_h_o_t_o currently requires the elevation model to be  in  meters,
       and the target location to be a metric coordinate system.
