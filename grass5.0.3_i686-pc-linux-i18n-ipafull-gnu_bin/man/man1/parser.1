       A set of routines in GRASS provides a mechanism for command-line  pars-
       ing.  The  routines standardize commands that expect command-line argu-
       ments.  When a user is familiar with the general form  of  command-line
       input  as  defined by the parser, it simplifies the necessity of remem-
       bering (or at least guessing) required command-line arguments  for  any
       GRASS command.


       The parser behaves in one of three ways:

              If no command-line arguments are entered by the user, the parser
              searches for an interactive version of the  command.  If  it  is
              found, control is passed over to this interactive version. If it
              is not found, the parser prompts the user for programmer-defined
              options  and flags. This prompting conforms to the same standard
              for every GRASS command that uses the parser routines.



              If command-line arguments are entered but do not include all the
              options  and  flags  that the programmer has defined as required
              arguments, three things happen:

              the parser passes an error message to the user indicating  which
              required  options  and/or  flags  were missing from the command-
              line,

              then the parser displays a complete usage message for that  com-
              mand, and finally

               the parser cancels execution of the command.




              If  all  necessary  options and flags are entered on the command
              line by the user, the parser executes the command with the given
              options and flags.
