       This  program  manages  display  frames on the user's graphics monitor.
       GRASS display programs at run-time connect with graphics rendering pro-
       grams.   While  the  display  programs  are identical on every hardware
       platform, the graphics rendering programs  are  (essentially  the  only
       GRASS programs) designed for individual hardware devices. These render-
       ing programs are managed with the GRASS  program  _d_._m_o_n.  Graphics  are
       displayed  in  rectangular frames on whatever graphics monitor the user
       is currently directing GRASS display output to.  These frames are  cre-
       ated  and managed with this program, NNoottee that GRASS frame contents are
       not retained when one frame covers another. You cannot  shuffle  frames
       from top to bottom and then back again.  They simply define rectangular
       areas on the screen where subsequent drawing will occur.



   FFllaaggss::
       --cc     Creates a new display frame on the graphics monitor.

       --ee     Removes all existing display frames and reinitializes the entire
              graphics screen (the full-screen display frame).

       --pp     Prints the name of the active frame, in which GRASS display out-
              put will appear.

       --ss     Selects a frame for the display of GRASS graphics. This frame is
              then known as the "active frame".

       --ll     List map names displayed in GRASS monitor

       --DD     Prints the status of the user's graphics monitor and active dis-
              play frame to standard output. Information includes the name and
              the  dimensions  of  the  current frame on the graphics monitor,
              given in the form _b_o_t_t_o_m top left right. This function is useful
              for debugging output, and for determining display screen coordi-
              nates.




   PPaarraammeetteerrss::
       ffrraammee==_n_a_m_e
              The name of the display frame to be created/selected.

       aatt==_b_o_t_t_o_m_,_t_o_p_,_l_e_f_t_,_r_i_g_h_t
              Where to place the frame (implies --cc).   Frame  coordinates  are
              stated in the form: _b_o_t_t_o_m_,_t_o_p_,_l_e_f_t_,_r_i_g_h_t. The lower-left corner
              of the graphics monitor always is at location 0,0 while the mon-
              itor's  upper-right  corner is always at 100,100 (the values are
              in percent).


NNOOTTEESS
       If the user has  created  multiple  display  frames  that  overlap  one
       another,  whatever the user displays in the active frame will overwrite
       those portions of the underlying frame where these frames overlap.
