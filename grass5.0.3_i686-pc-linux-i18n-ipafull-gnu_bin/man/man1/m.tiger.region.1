       _m_._t_i_g_e_r_._r_e_g_i_o_n is a program designed to evaluate a file of raw  type  1
       Census (TIGER) data and determine the geographic region covered by that
       input file.  Output is sent to standard out, and gives the east,  west,
       north, and south boundaries for the given input data file.


       If  the  user  specifies  the input file name and (optionally) the zone
       number or spheroid to be used on the command line, the program will run
       non-interactively;  if  no  zone  number or spheroid name is given, the
       default(s) will be used (see below).  Alternately, the user may  simply
       type _m_._t_i_g_e_r_._r_e_g_i_o_n on the command line; in this case, the program will
       prompt the user for parameter values using the  standard  GRASS  parser
       interface described in the manual entry for _p_a_r_s_e_r.

              Name of spheroid to be used.

       Available spheroids are:


       australian bessel clark66 clark80 everest international wgs72 wgs84


       It  is  recommended that the user choose the clark66 (default) spheroid
       when dealing with TIGER data as it is  the  most  consistent  with  the
       original data.

       If the user typed simply:


       mm..ttiiggeerr..rreeggiioonn iinnffiillee==_i_n_p_u_t_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e



       program output would look similar to this:


       Number of calculated zones is: 2



            INFO FOR ZONE 1:
            zone number:             13
            percentage of data points
            in this zone:            0.799489
            regional spread of points
            within this zone:
            north:                   5092049.155918
            south:                   5049238.983803
            east:                    734139.517650
            west:                    732514.747908

            INFO FOR ZONE 2:
            zone number:             14
            percentage of data points
            in this zone:            99.200508
            regional spread of points

            south:                   5036134.342322
            east:                    398030.217441
            west:                    265527.656108



       If  the  user  does not input the UTM zone number, it is calculated for
       them.  Then the zone number and region information are output,  and  if
       the program finds that the input data contains information in more than
       one UTM zone, then the output is given for all applicable zones.




       If instead the user supplies the UTM zone number, the output would look
       like that shown below:



            REGION FOR THIS DATA FILE:;

            north border:            5092049.155918
            south border:            5036134.342322
            east border:             398030.217441
            west border:             265527.656108
            (zone number:            14)

       This command must be compiled separately.  It will not automatically be
       included  in  the  compile  of   the   main   GRASS   code.    Although
       _m_._t_i_g_e_r_._r_e_g_i_o_n  does not need a FORTRAN compiler, it is used to support
       other TIGER data functions (like _v_._d_b_._r_i_m , _v_._i_n_._t_i_g_e_r, and _r_i_m)  which
       do require access to a FORTRAN compiler.


       TIGER  data  are  presented  in latitude/longitude format, and are con-
       verted to UTM coordinates using  coordinate  conversion  routines  con-
       tained  in the GRASS library.  If no UTM zone number is supplied by the
       user, the program calculates the appropriate zone(s) based on the input
       data provided.  The output then provides the UTM zone numbers found (if
       more than one), the geographic region covered within each zone, and the
       percentage  of  data  points  found  in  each zone.  The user must then
       decide which of these UTM zones contains the major  or  most  important
       portion of data values, so that the zone number can be supplied in cre-
       ating the GRASS location to hold the imported data and can be  provided
       to  the  importing  program  (_v_._i_n_._t_i_g_e_r).  Zone edges will be extended
       (reasonably) to include data values lying outside the chosen zone.   If
       desired,  _m_._t_i_g_e_r_._r_e_g_i_o_n  can be re-run, supplying the chosen zone num-
       ber, in order to evaluate the region edges of the input data set  (with
       the extended zone).
