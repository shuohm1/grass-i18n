       _d_._w_h_a_t_._r_a_s_t  - Allows the user to interactively query the category con-
       tents of multiple raster map layers at user-specified locations  within
       the current geographic region.

       _d_._w_h_a_t_._r_a_s_t  outputs  the  category  values  and labels associated with
       cell(s)  at  user-specified  location(s)  on  user-named   raster   map
       layer(s).


       The program will query the contents of raster map layer(s) named by the
       user on the command line. These map layers must  exist  in  the  user's
       current  mapset  search path.  If the user does not name any raster map
       layers on the command line, _d_._w_h_a_t_._r_a_s_t will query  the  category  con-
       tents  of  whatever raster map layer is already displayed in the active
       frame on the graphics monitor.


       The program activates the mouse, and expects the user to  indicate  the
       cell  location(s)  to  be  queried  by  depressing  a mouse button over
       desired location(s) within the current geographic region in the  active
       display frame on the graphic monitor.

   FFllaaggss::
       --11     Identify and query just one point location. Only one mouse click
              is executed. This option is provided for shell scripts and  pro-
              grams that want to obtain only one point from the user.

       --tt     Provide  only  terse output. This option is provided to simplify
              the parsing of output by other programs.

       --cc     Print out column and row for entire map region.


   PPaarraammeetteerrss::
       mmaapp==_n_a_m_e
              Name of existing raster map layer(s). Limit: 15 maps
              Default: Query map currently displayed in  the  active  graphics
              frame.

       ffss==_n_a_m_e
              Output field separator to be used (in terse mode only).
              Default: ::



       _d_._w_h_a_t_._r_a_s_t  output consists of the geographic coordinates of the loca-
       tion pointed to, and, for each map layer, the map layer name, the cate-
       gory  value,  and category label in the named raster map layers at this
       location.

       It is helpful, but not necessary, to first display a map to be used for
       reference  in the active display frame before running _d_._w_h_a_t_._r_a_s_t.  For
       example, the user might type  the  following  series  of  commands  and
       receive the output below.

       dd..rraasstt mmaapp==_s_o_i_l_s
              To first display the _s_o_i_l_s map in the active frame.


       dd..wwhhaatt..rraasstt mmaapp==_s_o_i_l_s_,_a_s_p_e_c_t User then moves the mouse to desired loca-
       tion on the displayed _s_o_i_l_s map layer, and presses the left mouse  but-
       ton to query the category contents of the _s_o_i_l_s and _a_s_p_e_c_t maps at this
       geographic location.  The program then outputs the below information to
       the user's terminal.

       The first line of output gives the easting (E) and northing (N) coordi-
       nates of the geographic location at which the user clicked  the  mouse.
       The  subsequent  two  lines  give the map name and mapset, map category
       value (within parentheses), and map  category  label  corresponding  to
       this  user-selected  map  location, for each of the maps queried by the
       user.


       The query may be repeated as often as desired using the left mouse but-
       ton.   The  right  button  on the mouse is used to quit the _d_._w_h_a_t_._r_a_s_t
       session.


       Users can set the --tt flag to obtain a terse  output  from  _d_._w_h_a_t_._r_a_s_t.
       This is useful when the user wishes output to be parsed by another pro-
       gram (like _a_w_k). If the --tt flag is set, users can also select the field
       separator used (with the ffss==_n_a_m_e option), or elect to use the default ::
       field separator.  In this case, the command

       dd..wwhhaatt..rraasstt --tt mmaapp==_s_o_i_l_s_,_a_s_p_e_c_t

       produces output in the form shown below. The first line of output gives
       the  easting,  northing,  and  the mouse button return value (see NOTES
       below).  Each subsequent line gives the map name and  its  mapset,  the
       category  value, and category label of the point specified on the user-
       named raster map layers.  The default output field separator, a  colon,
       is used since none was specified on the command line.

       Users can also use this program inside of shell scripts that require as
       input a map category value and a mouse  button  depressed.   Users  can
       choose  an option to run _d_._w_h_a_t_._r_a_s_t only once, and return only the map
       category value found and the number of the mouse button depressed.

NNOOTTEESS
       Mouse button return values are as follows: 0 indicates  no  button  was
       pressed,  1  indicates  that the left mouse button was pressed, 2 indi-
       cates the middle button was pressed, and 3  indicates  that  the  right
       mouse button was pressed.


       _d_._w_h_a_t_._r_a_s_t  will  always  print  its  output  to  the terminal screen.
       _d_._w_h_a_t_._r_a_s_t output can be redirected into a file; however,  if  it  is,
       the  output  will  go both to the screen and to the file.  For example:
       dd..wwhhaatt..rraasstt mmaapp==_s_o_i_l_s_,_a_s_p_e_c_t >> wwhhaatt..oouutt

       will both send _d_._w_h_a_t_._r_a_s_t output to the screen and capture its  output
       in the file named _w_h_a_t_._o_u_t.


       The maximum number of raster map layers that can be queried at one time
       is 15.


       _d_._w_h_a_t_._v_e_c_t allows the user to interactively query  the  category  con-
       tents of multiple vector map layers at user-specified locations.
