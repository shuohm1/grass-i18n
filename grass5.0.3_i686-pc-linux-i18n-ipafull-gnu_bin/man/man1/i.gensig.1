       _i_._g_e_n_s_i_g  is  a non-interactive method for generating input into _i_._m_a_x_-
       _l_i_k.  It can be used as the first pass in the GRASS two-pass  classifi-
       cation  process  (instead  of _i_._c_l_u_s_t_e_r or _i_._c_l_a_s_s).  It reads a raster
       map layer, called the training map, which has some  of  the  pixels  or
       regions already classified.  _i_._g_e_n_s_i_g will then extract spectral signa-
       tures from an image based on the classification of the  pixels  in  the
       training map and make these signatures available to _i_._m_a_x_l_i_k.


       The user would then execute the GRASS program _i_._m_a_x_l_i_k to actually cre-
       ate the final classified map.

       ttrraaiinniinnggmmaapp==_n_a_m_e
              ground truth training map


       This map must be prepared by the user in advance. Programs like _v_._d_i_g_i_t
       or  _r_._d_i_g_i_t  can  be used to define representative areas of the classes
       the user defines to be in the image.  Of course other methods could  be
       devised  by the user for creating this training map - _i_._g_e_n_s_i_g makes no
       assumption about the origin of this map layer. It simply creates signa-
       tures  for  the classes defined in the training map for the image to be
       classified (the image is specified in other options - see below).

       ggrroouupp==_n_a_m_e
              imagery group


       This is the name of the group that contains the band files  which  com-
       prise  the  image  to be analyzed. The _i_._g_r_o_u_p  command is used to con-
       struct groups of raster layers which comprise an image.



       ssuubbggrroouupp==_n_a_m_e
              subgroup containing image files


       This names the subgroup within the group that selects a subset  of  the
       bands to be analyzed. The _i_._g_r_o_u_p  command is also used to prepare this
       subgroup.  The subgroup mechanism allows the user to select a subset of
       all the band files that form an image.

       ssiiggnnaattuurreeffiillee==_n_a_m_e
              resultant signature file


       This  is the resultant signature file (containing the means and covari-
       ance matrices) for each class in the training map  that  is  associated
       with the band files in the subgroup select (see above).

       If  none  of  the arguments are specified on the command line, _i_._g_e_n_s_i_g
       will interactively prompt for the names of these maps and files.


       It should be noted that interactive mode here  only  means  interactive
       prompting  for  maps  and files.  It does not mean visualization of the
       signatures that result from the process.

       _i_._c_l_u_s_t_e_r for unsupervised clustering as an alternative to _i_._g_e_n_s_i_g  to
       create signatures.


       _i_._c_l_a_s_s for a graphic/interactive as an alternative to _i_._g_e_n_s_i_g to cre-
       ate signatures.
