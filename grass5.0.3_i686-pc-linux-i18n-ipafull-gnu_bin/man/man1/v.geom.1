       _v_._g_e_o_m takes a vector file as input and computes various triangulations
       respecting the input edges, or the convex hull of  the  sites.  The  z-
       coordinate  is read from the description field if it is specified, oth-
       erwise 0 is assumed. The z-coordinate is used for the MinMax-slope tri-
       angulation.  For all other computations the z-coordinate is ignored.


       The MinMax-angle triangulation is the triangulation for the sites which
       minmizes (lexicographically) the sorted vector of  all  the  angles  of
       triangles  in the triangulation. The constrained version also minimizes
       this vector but under the  constrained  that  prescribed  (i.e.  input)
       edges  are part of the final triangulation.  The MaxMin-height and Min-
       Max-slope triangulations are similar.  The algorithms used for the com-
       putations are not heuristics, they actually achieve the optimum.


       We use a simple extension of the algorithm used to compute the Delaunay
       triangulation in _s_._g_e_o_m to compute a triangulation which can be consid-
       ered  an approximatoin of the constrained Delaunay triangulation.  How-
       ever, this is only a (bad?) heuristic.


       The output is saved in vector file format. Edge labels of  input  edges
       will also be attached to the corresponding output edges.

              _h_u_l_l.  These correspond to the constrained planesweep triangula-
              tion, constrained Delaunay heuristic,  constrained  MinMax-angle
              triangulation,  constrained  MaxMin-height  triangulation,  con-
              strained MinMax-slope triangulation, and  convex  hull,  respec-
              tively.  (default is constrained planesweep triangulation).


NNOOTTEE
       The  computation  times  for the various operations depends strongly on
       the algorithm used.


       The plansweep triangulation and convex hull computation require _O_(_n _l_o_g
       _n_)  operations  in  the  worst case [Ed].  The Delaunay heuristic needs
       _O_(_n_^_2_) time in the worst case, however it performs much faster in prac-
       tice.  The MinMax-angle and MaxMin-height triangulations need _O_(_n_^_2 _l_o_g
       _n_) operations [EdTa], and the MinMax-slope triangulation  needs  _O_(_n_^_3_)
       operations [BeEd].


       Internally,  the  coordinates of the sites are stored in fix-point for-
       mat.  Therefore, the number of decimal digits cannot exceed 64 bit  (or
       approx.  16 decimal digits).


       It  is  important that the input vector file is reasonably "clean". The
       current implementation of _v_._g_e_o_m takes care of loops (i.e. zero  length
       edges), duplicate edges, and edges which are collinear and overlapping.
       However, because of the internal representation of coordinates in  fix-
       point  format it can happen that certain anomalies are introduced.  For
       examples edges can cross although they don't in the input  data.   Cur-
       rently,  the program does not test for such cases. If it occures one of
       two situations will happen. Either, the planesweep algorithm terminates
       with  a segmentation fault, or it will loop forever. For the data where
       we had problems these problems could be eliminated  if  we  first  used
       _v_._s_p_a_g.
