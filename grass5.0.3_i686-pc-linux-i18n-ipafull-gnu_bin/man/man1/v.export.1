       This program performs all of the processes that are needed  to  convert
       binary vector files into formatted ASCII files.


       It also creates support files:

         - an attribute flat file, which contains information for each area in
       the
              DLG file -- i.e., the DLG area number, the GRASS area label, and
              the GRASS category code (only created when exporting in DLG for-
              mat);

        - an attribute file which contains the information from the _d_i_g___a_t_t
              file (only created when exporting ASCII vector format).



       EXPORT FILES
       After  entering the command _v_._e_x_p_o_r_t, the user will be asked which type
       of file to export:

        Exports from GRASS Vector (_v_._d_i_g_i_t) Format



        1  -       ASCII DLG file from GRASS Vector Format

        2  -       ASCII   DIGIT file from GRASS Vector Format

        3  -       ASCII   SCS-GEF file from GRASS Vector Format

        4  -       ASCII   ARC/INFO file from GRASS Vector Format

        5  -       ASCII   DXF file from GRASS Vector Format


       If numbers 1-4 are chosen, _v_._e_x_p_o_r_t will respond with a request for the
       vector file name.  After the user enters the file name the program pro-
       ceeds to create the respective output format files.


       GRASS Vector to DLG File
       Converts binary vector files (such as those created by  _v_._d_i_g_i_t)  to  a
       DLG  file and creates the attribute file.  Both files are placed in the
       _d_l_g directory under a user selected name;  the attribute file has  .att
       appended.


       GRASS Vector File into ASCII Vector File
       Converts  a  binary vector file into a readable ASCII file.  Both files
       are placed int the _d_i_g___a_s_c_i_i directory under the same name as the given
       vector file, the attribute file has .att appended.


       GRASS Vector to SCS-GEF File
       Converts  binary  vector  files  to SCS-GEF files.  Creates the SCS-GEF
       header, lines, text, and feature files.   All  files  are  created  and
       placed  in a $LOCATION/gef directory as a single UNIX file under a user
       selected name.
       The following is the SCS-GEF file structure:
       header record 1
          |      |
       header record n
       -head
       line record 1
          |      |
       line record n
       -line
       text record 1
          |      |
       text record n
       -text
       feature record 1
          |      |
       feature record n
       -feat

       The user will be required to use standard  UNIX  commands  to  separate
       this  file into individual files as required by SCS-GEF specifications.


       GRASS Vector to ARC/INFO(generated) File
       Converts binary vector files to a "ARC  ungenerate"  format.   A  GRASS
       vector  file  to be exported to ARC/INFO must be either a line coverage
       (must contain only lines) or a polygon coverage (must contain only area
       edges).   Both  "ungenerate lines and points" files are created and are
       placed in a $LOCATION/arc directory under a user selected name.


       The binary vector name will be used to name the various files that will
       be  created  for export to ARC/INFO.  In the case of a labelled polygon
       coverage, the following three files will be created:  a lines file with
       the suffix .lin, a label-points file with the suffix .lab, and a label-
       text file with the suffix .txt.


       In the case of a line coverage the following two files will be created:
       a  lines file with the suffix .lin, and a label-text file with the suf-
       fix .txt.


       An unlabelled polygon or line coverage will  result  in  a  lines  file
       (.lin  suffix) only.  See the DATA FILE FORMATS section of v.import for
       more information on these files.


       GRASS Vector to DXF file
       Converts binary vector files to a "DXF" format.




NNOOTTEESS
       Support files must be built using the GRASS  program  _v_._s_u_p_p_o_r_t  before
       exporting any vector file.


       Other  ASCII  formats are useful when importing/exporting data into and
       from GRASS.  Such data files should be  in  ASCII  format  when  trans-
       ferred.
