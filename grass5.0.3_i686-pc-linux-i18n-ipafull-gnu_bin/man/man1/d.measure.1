       _d_._m_e_a_s_u_r_e provides the user with an  interactive  way  to  measure  the
       lengths and areas of lines and polygons drawn by the user in the active
       frame on the graphics monitor.  Lines and polygons are  drawn  using  a
       pointing  device  (mouse).  Each line segment is drawn in colors _c_1 and
       _c_2.  A mouse button menu indicates that the user can find out the  geo-
       graphic  coordinates of the cursor location, draw line segments between
       user-specified vertices, and quit _d_._m_e_a_s_u_r_e.  Lines  and  polygons  are
       defined  by the series of vertices marked by the user. If more than two
       successive vertices are drawn, _d_._m_e_a_s_u_r_e prints  the  area  encompassed
       (_d_._m_e_a_s_u_r_e  will  assume  the  area  is closed even if the user has not
       joined the first and last vertices).  Line lengths are  stated  in  the
       same units as those of the current LOCATION. In a XY-LOCATION, where no
       units are available, _d_._m_e_a_s_u_r_e prints a warning and gives results with-
       out  units.   Areas are stated in hectares, square miles, square meters
       and square kilometers.  Lines and polygons drawn using  _d_._m_e_a_s_u_r_e  will
       overlay  (not  overwrite)  whatever  display  currently  appears in the
       active frame on the graphics monitor.  The user can, for  example,  run
       _d_._r_a_s_t or _d_._v_e_c_t prior to running _d_._m_e_a_s_u_r_e, and use raster and/or vec-
       tor maps as a backdrop.

       The user can specify the colors in which line segments will be drawn by
       setting the values of _c_1 and _c_2 on the command line.  Default line col-
       ors (see below) will be used if the user does not specify the values of
       _c_1 and _c_2 on the command line.

       --ss     Suppesses  clear screen and writes messages to stderr instead of
              stdout. Usefull for work with the TCLTKGRASS gui.

       --mm     Use metric units (meters, kilometers) only

       --kk     Output results (additionally) in kilometers and  square  kilome-
              ters

       cc11==_n_a_m_e
              The first color in which each line segment is drawn, while being
              positioned.
              Options: red,  orange,  yellow,  green,  blue,  indigo,  violet,
              magenta, brown, gray, white, and black
              Default: _w_h_i_t_e

       cc22==_n_a_m_e
              The  second color in which each line segment is drawn, after its
              vertices are fixed.  Options: Same as _c_1.
              Default: _w_h_i_t_e

       _d_._m_e_a_s_u_r_e uses all segments drawn by the user when computing area.   If
       the  user  draws an area within another area, the combined area of both
       regions will be output.
