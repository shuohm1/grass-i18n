       _i_._t_a_p_e_._s_p_o_t is a program that extracts SPOT imagery from 9-track, half-
       inch tape.


       This program must be run in a LOCATION_NAME with an x,y coordinate sys-
       tem (i.e., a coordinate system with projection 0).  For further  infor-
       mation  regarding  this  LOCATION_NAME type refer to the _i_m_a_g_e_r_y manual
       entry.


       The first prompt in _i_._t_a_p_e_._s_p_o_t asks the user for the tape device name.
       Enter tape device name:

       This  is sometimes  /dev/rmt0 (for a half-inch tape having a density of
       1600 bpi), but this varies with each machine.


       The next prompt is:


       Mount SPOT tape and  hit RETURN

       The first menu in the program asks the user for information  about  the
       data.
             Please enter the following information

       TAPE IDENTIFICATION:                             __

       IMAGE DESCRIPTION:                               __

       TITLE FOR THE EXTRACTED CELL (RASTER) FILES:     __

       This program automatically reads the satellite name, tape product code,
       instrument name, interleaving indicator, spectral  mode,  preprocessing
       level  and  work  order  number into the field for TAPE IDENTIFICATION.
       The mission, path, row, scene shift, scene center date and time, orien-
       tation,  incidence,  azimuth, elevation angle, and absolute calibration
       coefficients and offsets are automatically entered into the  field  for
       IMAGE  DESCRIPTION.   User  can type in any other messages into the two
       sections and a description as the TITLE of raster map layer.  The  sec-
       ond menu is:
                       SPOT IMAGE EXTRACT
           Please select region of the image to extract

                    start row: 0______(1-3002)
                      end row: 0______(1-3002)

                    start col: 0______(1-3166)
                      end col: 0______(1-3166)


       AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT <ESC> TO CONTINUE
                     (OR <Ctrl-C> TO CANCEL)

       The  numbers in parentheses are the total number of rows and columns on
       the tape including zeros (filler).   This  information  and  additional
       information can also be obtained by running the program _m_._e_x_a_m_i_n_e_._t_a_p_e.
       _m_._e_x_a_m_i_n_e_._t_a_p_e will read any tape and provide the user with the  number
       of  files  on  a  tape, the number of records on a tape, and the record
       lengths.  Any subset of the image on the tape may be extracted.  For  a
       discussion of row and column extraction see the subheading enTITLEd ROW
       AND COLUMN EXTRACTION below.


       The next menu is:
         Please mark an x by the bands you want extracted

                             _____ 1
                             _____ 2
                             _____ 3

       AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT <ESC> TO CONTINUE
                     (OR <Ctrl-C> TO CANCEL)

       SPOT imagery has three bands, but the user may want to extract a subset
       of these bands.  See the subheading in this entry enTITLEd ROW AND COL-
       UMN EXTRACTION.


       The user then is asked to enter the prefix/group name  for  the  raster
       band  files  to  be  created.   This  name  will precede each band file
       extracted into GRASS.  For example, if two bands are extracted the fol-
       lowing two band files will result:


       _p_r_e_f_i_x_n_a_m_e_._1
       _p_r_e_f_i_x_n_a_m_e_._2


       The  specified  _p_r_e_f_i_x_n_a_m_e  will also automatically become the name for
       the imagery group file being created.  Each image or subset (i.e., each
       run of _i_._t_a_p_e_._s_p_o_t) should be given a unique prefix/group name.



       The  extraction  process will begin by first skipping a number of files
       which are not data or  not  requested,  advancing  to  the  first  band
       requested,  forwarding  to  the  requested column, and then reading the
       data.  After extracting the requested rows and columns from each  band,
       the  program  creates support files for the raster band map layer.  The
       percent completion of  the  extraction  is  displayed  on  the  screen.
       Because  sometimes SPOT imagery is very large and is stored in multiple
       tape sets, the program is designed to read image by  pausing  when  the
       tape  need  to  be  changed  and inform the user to mount and load next
       tape.  The number of tapes required to store one scene depends  on  the
       number of bytes per inch (bpi) in which the data are stored.


       The  extracted band files will be listed as raster map layers available
       in the current MAPSET and may be displayed  using  the  GRASS  commands
       _d_._d_i_s_p_l_a_y, _d_._r_a_s_t, or _i_._p_o_i_n_t_s.

       The  display options in GRASS allow the user to locate rows and columns
       on the digital image.  If enough disk space is available, one  band  of
       an  entire  image or one band of a portion of an image known to contain
       the area of interest, can be extracted and displayed.  The _m_e_a_s_u_r_e_m_e_n_t_s
       option  in  _d_._d_i_s_p_l_a_y, or _d_._w_h_e_r_e (following use of _d_._r_a_s_t) will echo x
       and y coordinates to the screen.  (These coordinates will display nega-
       tive  numbers  in  the north-south direction, but ignoring the negative
       sign will yield the row number.)  See the _i_m_a_g_e_r_y manual entry for fur-
       ther explanation.


       Each  scene  of a SPOT image contains filler on both the left and right
       sides of the quad.  The user may want to identify the  row  and  column
       numbers  in order to exclude the filler.  This filler will otherwise be
       extracted with the image and take up unnecessary disk space.


       If a photograph of the digital image is available, the rows and columns
       to  be  extracted  can be determined from it by associating inches with
       the total number of known rows and columns in the scene.  For  example,
       if the total length of the photograph is 12 inches, the total number of
       rows on the tape is 2000, and the  northwest  corner  of  the  area  of
       interest  begins  2  inches from the top of the photo, then: 12" / 2000
       rows = 2" / x rows x = 333.333

       The northwest corner of the area of interest starts at  row  333.   The
       starting  row,  ending  row,  starting column, and ending column can be
       calculated in this manner.

       After extracting an image from tape the geographic region definition in
       the  x,y  coordinate LOCATION_NAME will be set based upon the extracted
       rows and columns from the tape.  The  relationship  between  the  image
       rows  and  columns and the coordinates of the geographic region is dis-
       cussed in the _i_m_a_g_e_r_y format manual entry.


       This program is interactive and requires no command line arguments.
