       _r_._s_u_r_f_._a_r_e_a  Calculates area of regular 3D triangulated points (centers
       of cells) in current region by adding areas of  triangles.   Therefore,
       area  of  a  flat surface will be reported as (rows + cols -1)*(area of
       cell) less than area of flat region due to a half row and  half  column
       missing around the perimeter.


       NNOOTTEE::   This calculation is heavily dependent on data resolution (think
       of it as a fractal shoreline problem,  the  more  resolution  the  more
       detail,  the  more  area,  etc).   This  program uses the _C_U_R_R_E_N_T _G_R_A_S_S
       _R_E_G_I_O_N, not the resolution of the map.  This  is  especially  important
       for  surfaces with NULL values and highly irregular edges.  The program
       does not [currently] attempt to correct for  the  error  introduced  by
       this _e_d_g_e _e_f_f_e_c_t.


       This  version  actually  calculates  area twice for each triangle pair,
       keeping a running minimum and maximum area depending on  the  direction
       of the diagonal used.


       Reported totals are:

              "Plan" area of NULL values within the current GRASS region

              "Plan"  area  within  calculation region (rows-1 * cols-1 * cel-
              larea)

              Average of the minimum and maximum calculated 3d  triangle  area
              within this region

              "Plan" area within current GRASS region (rows * cols * cellarea)

              Scaling of calculated area to current GRASS region (see NOTE)



       The program will be run non-interactively if  the  user  specifies  the
       program parameter values and desired flag settings on the command line,
       using the form:


       rr..ssuurrff..aarreeaa iinnppuutt==_n_a_m_e [vvssccaallee==_v_a_l_u_e]



       Alternately, the user can simply type rr..ssuurrff..aarreeaa on the command  line,
       without program arguments.  In this case, the user will be prompted for
       needed inputs and option choices using the standard GRASS  user  inter-
       face described in the manual entry for _p_a_r_s_e_r .

   PPaarraammeetteerrss::
       iinnppuutt==_n_a_m_e
              Name of an existing raster map layer to use for the calculation.

       vvssccaallee==_v_a_l_u_e
              Optional vertical scaling value to use in surface area  calcula-
              tion.


NNOOTTEESS
       _r_._s_u_r_f_._a_r_e_a  works best when the surface being evaluated extends to the
       edges of the current GRASS region and the  cell  resolution  is  small.
       Surfaces  which  are especially long and thin and have highly irregular
       boudaries will tend to have underestimated surface  areas.   Setting  a
       high  cell resolution (small area) will greatly reduce this impact, but
       will cause longer processing times.
