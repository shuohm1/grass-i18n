       _p_h_o_t_o_._c_a_m_e_r_a  creates  or  modifies entries in a camera reference file.
       For ortho-photo rectification, a camera reference file is required  for
       computation of scanned image to photo-coordinate transformation parame-
       ters.  There are two coordinate systems: The  image  coordinate  system
       (in  pixels)  and  the  photo  coordinate system (in milli-meters). The
       inner orientation establishes a relation between  the  pixels  and  the
       image coordinates with help of fiducial marks.


       The first prompt in the program will ask you for the name of the camera
       reference file to be created or modified.  You may create a new  camera
       reference  file  by  entering  a new name, or modify an existing camera
       reference file by entering the name of an existing camera file.


       After entering the camera file name, following menu is displayed:


       Please provide the following information

       The camera name and identification describe the camera reference  file.
       The  calibrated focal length and the point of symmetry are used in com-
       puting the photo-to-target  transformation  parameters.   These  values
       should be entered from the camera calibration report (usually available
       from the photograph supplier).

       The photo coordinate system origin is the so-called calibrated  princi-
       pal  point  (PP, Principal Point of Symmetry) which is in the center of
       the image.  The origin of the axes is at the intersection of the  radii
       traced  from  the fiducial marks. In the ideal case of no deviations in
       the camera (see camera  calibration  certificate)  the  center  is  the
       origin  and the values are 0 for both X and Y of Point of Symmetry. But
       usually the principal point does not fall on the  intersection  of  the
       radii at the center of the picture. This excentricity is usually of the
       order of a few micrometers.


       You are then asked to enter the X and Y photo coordinates of each fidu-
       cial  as  follows.   These  fiducials (or reseau) marks are index marks
       imaged on film which serve as reference photo  coordinate  system.  The
       maximum  number  of  fiducials will determine the number of fiducial or
       reseau coordinate pairs to be entered below. The origin is  the  center
       of  the image (or the point of symmetry) and X and Y are left-right and
       up-down. The order is up to the  user,  but  must  be  kept  consistent
       throughout the rectification process.


       On  this  screen  you should enter the fiducial or reseau photo-coordi-
       nates as given in the camera calibration report. The X, and  Y  coordi-
       nates are in milli-meters from the principle point.
