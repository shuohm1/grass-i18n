       _v_._i_n_._s_d_t_s creates one or more GRASS vector maps in the  current  mapset
       from  a  Spatial Data Transfer Standard dataset conforming to the Topo-
       logical  Vector  Profile  (TVP).   The  program  generates  GRASS  _d_i_g,
       _d_i_g___a_t_t,  and  _d_i_g___c_a_t_s files.  Also, if requested, files of attributes
       in database-ready form are created, along with  scripts  to  create  an
       approprate  SQL-compliant  relational  database, and load the attribute
       files into the new database.  Special database-ready  files  of  tables
       linking the attributes to the GRASS vector map layer or layers are also
       generated.


       The source SDTS dataset must be in the user's current  directory.   The
       files  that  make  up  the  dataset  are  listed in the dataset's Cata-
       log/Directory file (CATD); this file is specified by the user with  the
       ccaattdd parameter.


       _v_._i_n_._s_d_t_s creates maps in your current mapset, and will only import map
       data if there is correspondence between the current mapset's coordinate
       system  and  that  of the transfer set; in addition, for UTM (and State
       Plane), Zone designations must match.  These specifications can be dis-
       played  be  running _v_._i_n_._s_d_t_s in "Information only" mode.  "Information
       only" mode is automatically put in effect when  there  is  a  mis-match
       between source and target coordinate systems.


       An  SDTS  dataset may consist of one or several distinct map layers (or
       "2-D manifolds", in SDTS terminology), coinciding with one or more par-
       titions  of  the  earth's surface.  If a dataset contains more than one
       map layer, the grouping of object data into individual map layers,  and
       of  groups  of  map  layers, is specified in the Catalog/Spatial Domain
       (CATS) file, in terms of "domain", "map",  "theme",  and/or  "manifold"
       ("aggregate  object").   If available, this information is displayed to
       the user in "Information Only" mode.  The user can then either

       (1) import all the map layers in a
              transfer at once, or (2) select a subset of  the  transfer  con-
              sisting  of  one  or  more maps by specifying a domain name, map
              name, etc.

       --ii     "Information-only" mode.  Information about the dataset and  any
              individual  map layers in the dataset are displayed. No map lay-
              ers or attribute  files  are  generated.  Information  displayed
              includes  basic identifying data (TITLE of transfer dataset, map
              date, dataset creation date, scale,  coordinate  system,  etc.).
              For individual maps, any names found in the CATS file specifying
              map, theme, domain, manifold, are  given.  Bounding  coordinates
              for each map layer are also printed.
              The  program  will also run in "information only" mode if (1) no
              output name is specified,  or (2) the coordinate system, or,  in
              the  case  of  UTM  and  State Plane, Zone, of the dataset to be
              imported does not match the current mapset.

       --ll     Import object  link  table(s)  only;  do  not  create  attribute
              tables.   If  this  flag  is set, and if ddbbppaatthh is set, only the
              vector map (_d_i_g, _d_i_g___a_t_t, and _d_i_g___c_a_t_s) and the file  containing
              the  database-ready  table  linking  the  vector  map  with  the
              attribute tables will be created; the attribute files themselves
              will not be created.  This option is useful if the user wants to
              selectively import data layers from an SDTS dataset with  multi-
              ple  maps.  One map could be imported with its object link table
              and the full set of attributes; subsequent layers imported  with
              the   "--ll"   option  would  avoid  recopying  the  full  set  of
              attributes.




   PPaarraammeetteerrss::
       ccaattdd==_n_a_m_e
              Full name of SDTS file containing the  Catalog/Directory  (CATD)
              module for the source dataset. The file name format is specified
              by SDTS and the TVP as _x_x_x_x_C_A_T_D_._D_D_F, where _x_x_x_x are 4 digits  or
              upper-case letters or any combination therof. The CATD file must
              be located along with the rest of the SDTS dataset in  the  cur-
              rent  directory.   The  CATD  file contains a listing of all the
              dataset files, and is thus the necessary starting point for  the
              transfer process.
              Note  that  the  same  four-character prefix of the CATD file is
              used for all files in the SDTS dataset. This prefix is also used
              by  _v_._i_n_._s_d_t_s  for the naming of the output attribute files (see
              _T_h_e _G_R_A_S_S_-_S_D_T_S _U_s_e_r _G_u_i_d_e for details.)



       oouuttppuutt==_n_a_m_e
              name for output vector map layer.  If the SDTS dataset  contains
              multiple  maps,  and  if no particular one is specified, causing
              all the maps to be imported, maps will be distinguished by  name
              plus numeric suffix. If not specified the module runs in "infor-
              mation mode" (-i flag) and no output is written.



       ddbbppaatthh==_n_a_m_e
              full path to location for placement of database-ready  attribute
              files   preparatory   to  their  installation  in  a  relational
              database.  Path must exist and be writable by the user.  Setting
              the  ddbbaatthh  parameter causes database-ready files to be created;
              otherwise they are not created.

              if one or more  domain,  map,  theme,  or  manifold  ("aggregate
              object")  names  are  given  in the SDTS dataset Catalog/Spatial
              Domain (CATS) file, map layers so  designated  can  be  selected
              with  the  appropriate  parameter. "Information only" mode lists
              any such names found in the CATS file.

       SDTS and the Topological Vector Profile define two basic types of  spa-
       tial  objects:  simple  spatial objects, i.e., lines,  polygons, nodes,
       etc.; and composite objects, which are made up of  one  or  more  other
       simple and/or composite spatial objects.  SDTS composite objects, which
       GRASS cannot handle directly, are imported as  records  in  RDBMS-ready
       tables.  Details on the mapping of simple and composite spatial objects
       between SDTS and GRASS may be found in the _G_R_A_S_S_-_S_D_T_S _U_s_e_r _G_u_i_d_e.



SSDDTTSS AATTTTRRIIBBUUTTEE IIMMPPOORRTT
       Only a brief explanation of SDTS attributes and v.in.sdts's handling of
       them is given here.  See the _G_R_A_S_S_/_S_D_T_S _U_s_e_r _G_u_i_d_e for details.


       SDTS  is  capable  of  substantial  attribute complexity.  SDTS distin-
       guishes between two basic kinds of attributes: primary  attributes  are
       related  directly  to spatial objects (simple or composite), while sec-
       ondary  attributes  are  related  to  primary  or  to  other  secondary
       attributes.   In  SDTS, attributes are stored in relational tables, and
       spatial objects may be linked to multiple attributes  in  one  or  more
       different  attribute tables.  The schema of an SDTS dataset--the number
       and kind of attribute fields and attribute tables,  and  the  relation-
       ships  among  attributes and objects--is not predefined by the Standard
       or the Profile, but is determined by the producer of the dataset.


       For most kinds of data likely to be  available  through  SDTS,  optimal
       access requires use of GRASS with a relational database management sys-
       tem.  In support of this, _v_._i_n_._s_d_t_s imports SDTS attribute tables in  a
       form  ready  for  use with your RDBMS.  It also produces SQL-compatible
       scripts to set up the relational database and install the data.


       _d_i_g___a_t_t _a_n_d _d_i_g___c_a_t_s _f_i_l_e_s_:  The  program  does  generate  _d_i_g___a_t_t  and
       _d_i_g___c_a_t_s  files,  and  for relatively simple SDTS datasets, i.e., those
       with  one-to-one  object-attribute  relationships   with   all   object
       attributes  in  a  single  attribute  table,  an  associated relational
       database is not necessary.  In addition, for more complex datasets, the
       _d_i_g___a_t_t  and _d_i_g___c_a_t_s files are constructed in such a way as to facili-
       tate post-import incorporation of  selected  data  from  the  attribute
       files for use without recourse to a relational database.  Specifically,
       the contents of the generated _d_i_g___a_t_t and _d_i_g___c_a_t_s files  are  as  fol-
       lows:



       _d_i_g___a_t_t
              Contains  an  entry  for  each  attributed  non-composite object
              (line, polygon, point). each entry will  be  assigned  a  unique
              category  integer  value.  These integers, or feature-IDs (FID),
              also uniquely identify the same spatial objects,  in  the  rela-
              tional  database  object link table.  _d_i_g___c_a_t_s For datasets with
              one-to-one object-attribute relationships and a  single  object-
              related  attribute  module,  only  one  database-ready  "object-
              attribute" file is created, and the _d_i_g___c_a_t_s records  are  given
              the  same  content, as the generated database-ready file. Record
              structure is as follows:
              FID | obj_code | attr_code | attr. field 1 |...| attr. field n |

              (_o_b_j___c_o_d_e  and  _a_t_t_r___c_o_d_e  are codes, derived from record IDs in
              the SDTS dataset, which function as keys  in  the  import  rela-
              tional database. See _T_h_e _G_R_A_S_S_-_S_D_T_S _U_s_e_r _G_u_i_d_e for details.)


       For  other  datasets,  the _d_i_g___c_a_t_s file is identical in content to the
       generated GRASS-database object link table, and records would have  the
       structure:
       FID | obj_code     or    FID | obj_code | attr_code
