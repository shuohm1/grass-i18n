       _d_._m_e_n_u allows the user to create a menu containing a TITLE and options,
       and  to  display this menu in the active frame on the graphics monitor.
       After the menu is displayed in the active frame,  the  pointing  device
       (mouse)  is  activated  and  must  be  used  to  select one of the menu
       options.  The number associated with the selected menu option  is  then
       printed  to  standard  output and the program exits.  This program pro-
       vides GRASS macro writers with a mouse interface for users.


       Parameters can be stated on the  command  line,  from  within  standard
       input, or (as illustrated in EXAMPLE) from within a script file.


       The  user  can  specify  the  menu's  background, text, and line colors
       (bbccoolloorr, ttccoolloorr, and ddccoolloorr) and the menu size (ssiizzee)  on  the  command
       line.  If  the  user  sets  at least one of these values on the command
       line, any remaining values that are not specified on the  command  line
       will  be  set  (automatically)  to  their  default  values (see below).
       Alternately, the user can simply type dd..mmeennuu on the  command  line;  in
       this  case,  the  program  will prompt the user for the menu colors and
       text size using the standard GRASS parser  interface.   The  user  will
       then  be  (silently) prompted to enter the menu's location and contents
       through standard input (see Menu Information, below).



   PPaarraammeetteerrss::
       bbccoolloorr==_n_a_m_e
              Sets the color of the menu background (the  rectangle  on  which
              the text sits).
              Options:  red,  orange,  yellow,  green,  blue,  indigo, violet,
              magenta, brown, gray, white, and black.
              Default: _b_l_a_c_k

       ttccoolloorr==_n_a_m_e
              Sets the color of the menu text.
              Options: Same as those for _b_c_o_l_o_r.
              Default: _w_h_i_t_e

       ddccoolloorr==_n_a_m_e
              Sets the line color used to divide text lines in the menu.
              Options: Same as those for _b_c_o_l_o_r.
              Default: _w_h_i_t_e

       ssiizzee==_v_a_l_u_e
              Sets the menu's text size to  the  specified  value.  Sizes  are
              stated  as percentages of the height of the active graphics dis-
              play frame.
              Options: 1 - 100
              Default: 3 (i.e., 3%)


   MMeennuu IInnffoorrmmaattiioonn::
       After the user has (optionally) specified menu  colors  and  size,  the
       program expects the user to enter information about the menu's location
       and content.  The menu will be placed in the lower left corner  of  the
       active  display frame by default if the user does not position it else-
       where using the .T or .L commands.


       The user specifies the menu contents by typing in a menu TITLE followed
       by  the  option choices to appear in the menu when displayed.  The user
       _m_u_s_t enter a menu TITLE and at least one menu option.

       ..TT _v_a_l_u_e
              Specifies the menu's distance from the  active  display  frame's
              top edge (as a percentage of the active frame's height).
              Note: Not required

       ..LL _v_a_l_u_e
              Specifies  the  menu's  distance from the active display frame's
              left edge (as a percentage of the active frame's width).
              Note: Not required

       _m_e_n_u _T_I_T_L_E
              A TITLE that describes the type of options listed in  the  menu,
              and  that  will  appear  at  the top of the menu when it is dis-
              played.

       _o_p_t_i_o_n _n_a_m_e(s)
              The options that will appear in the menu when  displayed.   Each
              menu  option  should  appear  on  a separate line.  The user may
              enter as many options as desired, but must enter  at  least  one
              menu option.

       Note:  The  user should choose a menu size and location that will allow
       all menu options to be displayed in the active frame.


       If the user enters the menu TITLE and  option(s)  from  standard  input
       (i.e.,  at the keyboard rather than from a file), the user should enter
       _c_o_n_t_r_o_l_-_d  to end input and display the menu in the active frame on the
       graphics  monitor.   (Note: The _d_._m_e_n_u program can also be incorporated
       into UNIX Bourne shell script macros.  The below example shows how this
       might be done.)

EEXXAAMMPPLLEE
       In the following example, the shell script _m_e_n_u_2 calls the shell script
       _c_o_l_o_r_._s_e_l_e_c_t which contains _d_._m_e_n_u commands to display a  menu  in  the
       current  frame  on  the  graphics  monitor.   After the user selects an
       option from the display menu, the selection number is available for use
       by _m_e_n_u_2.

   CCoonntteennttss ooff ffiillee _m_e_n_u_2:

       #! /bin/csh -f
       set option = 0
       set colors = (red green blue black white )
       @ option = `color.select`

       if ($option <= 5) then
            set color = $colors[$option]
            echo $color

       endif
       exit


   CCoonntteennttss ooff ffiillee _c_o_l_o_r_._s_e_l_e_c_t:

       #! /bin/csh -f
       d.menu bcolor=red tcolor=green dcolor=yellow size=5 << EOF
       Color Choices
       Option 1
       Option 2
       Option 3
       Option 4
       Option 5
       EOF



       If  the user runs _m_e_n_u_2, a menu will be displayed on the graphics moni-
       tor that has red background, green text, with menu options  divided  by
       yellow lines, and a text size of 5% of the active display frame height.
       The mouse cursor will become active, allowing the user  to  select  (by
       pointing  with  the  mouse)  one  of the displayed menu options.  Here,
       these menu options are called _O_p_t_i_o_n _1, _O_p_t_i_o_n _2, and  _O_p_t_i_o_n  _3,  etc.
       The  first  line  of  text (here, the words _C_o_l_o_r _C_h_o_i_c_e_s) contains the
       TITLE of the menu; this line is nnoott a menu option that can be chosen by
       the user with the mouse. When the user presses one of the mouse buttons
       while pointing to the desired menu choice, the  number  of  the  option
       chosen  will be available for capture by the shell script _m_e_n_u_2.  _m_e_n_u_2
       is a simple example that takes this information and only echoes  it  to
       the screen.

NNOOTTEESS
       Although  the user can vary text size, all text within the same menu is
       displayed in a single text size (and font). If the user specifies  that
       items  included in the menu's text be displayed in different sizes, all
       text will be displayed in the size stated last.
