       ii..ccllaassss   -  An imagery function that generates spectral signatures for
       an image by allowing the user to  outline  regions  of  interest.   The
       resulting signature file can be used as input for _i_._m_a_x_l_i_k or as a seed
       signature file for _i_._c_l_u_s_t_e_r.

       _i_._c_l_a_s_s performs the first pass in the GRASS two-pass supervised  image
       classification  process; the GRASS program _i_._m_a_x_l_i_k executes the second
       pass.  Both programs must be run to generate a classified map in  GRASS
       raster format.


       _i_._c_l_a_s_s  is  an  interactive  program that allows the user to outline a
       region on the screen and calculate the spectral signature based on  the
       cells  that  are within that region.  During this process the user will
       be shown a histogram of the region for each image band.  The  user  can
       also  display  the  cells  of the image bands which fall within a user-
       specified number of standard deviations from the means in the  spectral
       signature.   By  doing  this, the user can see how much of the image is
       likely to be put into the class associated with the current  signature.


       The  spectral  signatures  that result are composed of region means and
       covariance matrices.  These region means and  covariance  matrices  are
       used in the second pass (_i_._m_a_x_l_i_k) to classify the image.


       Alternatively, the spectral signatures generated by _i_._c_l_a_s_s can be used
       for seed means for the clusters in the _i_._c_l_u_s_t_e_r program.

UUSSEERR IINNPPUUTTSS
       The first screen in the program _i_._c_l_a_s_s asks the user for  the  imagery
       _g_r_o_u_p and _s_u_b_g_r_o_u_p to be analyzed:
       LOCATION: location    SUPERVISED CLASSIFIER     MAPSET: demo

            Please select the group and subgroup to be analyzed

       GROUP:      spot_______   (list will show available groups)
       SUBGROUP:   123________   (list will show available subgroups)


            AFTER COMPLETING ALL ANSWERS, HIT <ESC> TO CONTINUE
                          (OR <Ctrl-C> TO CANCEL)



       The  _g_r_o_u_p  should  contain  the  imagery bands that the user wishes to
       classify.  The _s_u_b_g_r_o_u_p is a subset of this group.  The user must  cre-
       ate  a group and a subgroup by running the GRASS program _i_._g_r_o_u_p before
       running _i_._c_l_a_s_s.  The subgroup should contain only the image bands that
       the user wishes to classify.  Note that this subgroup must contain more
       than one band.


       After the first screen, the program asks the user for the name  of  the
       resulting  signature  file.  The signature file is both the output file
       for _i_._c_l_a_s_s and the required input file for the GRASS program _i_._m_a_x_l_i_k.
       It  contains  the region means and covariance matrices that are used to
       classify an image in _i_._m_a_x_l_i_k.


       After entering the resulting signature file name, the user is asked  to
       enter  the  name of a seed signature file.  This is optional.  A "seed"
       signature file is a previously created signature  file.   Such  a  seed
       signature  file  may  be  the result of an earlier run of _i_._c_l_a_s_s.  The
       seed signature file is copied into the  new  resulting  signature  file
       before  any  new signatures are added by _i_._c_l_a_s_s.  In this way, you can
       collect the work from several sessions with _i_._c_l_a_s_s into one  signature
       file.


       Next,  the user is asked to enter the name of the raster map to be dis-
       played during the process of outlining regions.   Typically,  the  user
       will  want to enter the name of a color composite previously created by
       _i_._c_o_m_p_o_s_i_t_e.  However, the user can enter  the  name  of  any  existing
       raster  map.   This  leaves  the  potential  for using a raster map not
       directly derived from the image as a backdrop on  which  the  user  can
       outline the classes of interest.


       At this point the _i_._c_l_a_s_s graphics screen will be drawn on the graphics
       monitor and the user will be directed to  use  the  mouse.   From  this
       point on the user will primarily work with the mouse, selecting options
       from the menus and outlining regions on the screen.  The only time that
       the user will need to return to the text terminal is to enter names for
       the signatures created.

       All of the menus in the _i_._c_l_a_s_s program are displayed across the bottom
       of the graphics monitor in the Menu Frame.  To select  an  option  from
       one  of  these  menus,  simply place the cursor over your selection and
       press any button on the mouse.  Each of the menus is discussed  in  the
       following paragraphs.

   TThhee CCoommmmaanndd MMeennuu
       The Command Menu includes the following selections:

       _Z_o_o_m   This  command allows the user to outline a rectangular region in
              either the Map or Zoom Display Frames and  the  region  is  dis-
              played,  magnified,  to  fit  in  the Zoom Display Frame.  A red
              rectangle is drawn in the Map  Display  Frame,  indicating  what
              area the Zoom Display Frame shows.


       To outline the rectangular region simply use any mouse button to anchor
       the first corner of the border and then use any button  to  choose  the
       other corner.

       _D_e_f_i_n_e _r_e_g_i_o_n
              This  selection  takes  the  user to the Region Menu.  This menu
              includes the options that allow the user to outline a region  of
              interest on the displayed raster map.

       _R_e_d_i_s_p_l_a_y _m_a_p
              This selection takes the user to the Redisplay Menu.  The Redis-
              play Menu allows the user to redraw map display frames.

       _A_n_a_l_y_z_e _r_e_g_i_o_n
              This selection starts the process  of  analyzing  the  currently
              defined  region.  A histogram of the defined region will be dis-
              played for each band.  On the histogram for each band, the mean,
              standard  deviation,  minimum  cell value and maximum cell value
              are marked.  The  histograms  are  automatically  scaled  in  an
              attempt to fit the data into the space available, but it is pos-
              sible that all of the data will not fit.  In this case, as  much
              of  the data as possible, centered around the mean, will be dis-
              played.  After the histograms are displayed, the  user  will  be
              given the Signature Menu.

       _Q_u_i_t   The  user  should  make  this  selection to end the session with
              _i_._c_l_a_s_s.


   TThhee RReeggiioonn MMeennuu
       The Region Menu contains the following selections:

       _E_r_a_s_e _r_e_g_i_o_n
              This selection erases any currently defined region.

       _D_r_a_w _r_e_g_i_o_n
              This selection allows the user to use the mouse to draw a region
              on  either  the  Map  or  Zoom Display Frame.  An explanation of
              which mouse buttons to use is displayed in the Menu Frame.   The
              user  does not need to try to complete the region boundary.  The
              last line of the region will be added when the user selects  the
              Complete region option on the Region Menu.

       _R_e_s_t_o_r_e _l_a_s_t _r_e_g_i_o_n
              This selection restores the last region that was drawn.  After a
              region is completed, it will be  saved  to  be  restored  later.
              Only one previous region is saved.

       _C_o_m_p_l_e_t_e _r_e_g_i_o_n
              This  selection  completes  the  region  that is currently being
              drawn.  As noted above, it  saves  the  complete  region  to  be
              restored  later,  if  needed.  Once the user has made a complete
              region, it can be analyzed with the Analyze Region selection  on
              the Command Menu.

       _D_o_n_e   Use this selection to return to the Command Menu.


TThhee RReeddiissppllaayy MMaapp MMeennuu
       The  Redisplay  Map Menu has the following selections, which are useful
       to redraw the raster maps displayed in the Map and Zoom Display Frames.

       _M_a_p _g_e_o_g_r_a_p_h_i_c _r_e_g_i_o_n
              This selection causes the raster map in the Map Display Frame to
              be redrawn.

       _Z_o_o_m _r_e_g_i_o_n
              This selection causes the Zoom Display Frame to be redrawn.

       _B_o_t_h   This selection causes both the Map and Zoom Display Frames to be
              redrawn.

       _C_a_n_c_e_l Use this selection if you do not want to redisplay either of the
              above regions.  The user will be returned to the Command Menu.


   TThhee AAnnaallyyzzee RReeggiioonn MMeennuu
       The Analyze Region Menu contains the Signature Menu, which  allows  the
       user  to  set  the number of standard deviations and the display color,
       and then to display (as an overlay) the cells that match the  signature
       within the number of standard deviations specified.  Note that once the
       matching cells are displayed, the Map Display Frame must be redisplayed
       to  see  only  the original raster map again.  The following selections
       are available on the Signature Menu:

       _S_e_t _s_t_d _d_e_v_'_s
              This selection allows the user to set  the  number  of  standard
              deviations from the mean for the maximum and minimum range.  The
              maximum and minimum range is used when finding  the  cells  that
              "match"  the  signature.   The  user is presented with a menu of
              typical choices and an "Other" option.  If the "Other" option is
              selected,  enter the number of standard deviations from the key-
              board on the text terminal.  Otherwise, the selected option will
              be  used.   When  the  number of standard deviations is set, the
              histograms for each band will be redrawn with  the  maximum  and
              minimum range marked.


       Note  that  the  number in parentheses on this selection is the current
       number of standard deviations.

       _S_e_t _c_o_l_o_r
              This selection allows the user to set the color for the  display
              of  cells  that "match" the current signature.  The user is pre-
              sented with a menu of color choices.  The color selected will be
              used when the Display Matches Menu selection is made.


       Note  that  the  color  in parentheses on this selection is the current
       color for display.

       _D_i_s_p_l_a_y _m_a_t_c_h_e_s
              This selection displays the cells that "match" the current  sig-
              nature  in the current color.  A cell "matches" the current sig-
              nature if the cell value in each band  is  between  the  minimum
              range  and  maximum range for that band defined by the number of
              standard deviations currently set.

       _D_o_n_e   When this selection is chosen, the user will be asked whether or
              not  he/she  would  like  to save the current signature.  If the
              user answers with the "Yes" selection, he/she will be  asked  to
              enter a description for the resultant signature file on the text
              terminal keyboard.  The saved signature file description will be
              used  by  _i_._m_a_x_l_i_k to name the category that is created from the
              current signature.  After either a "No" answer or the  signature
              description  is  entered,  the  user  is returned to the Command
              Menu.


NNOOTTEESS
       _i_._c_l_a_s_s uses the current MASK to generate the overlay  for  cells  that
       match  a  signature.   As a result, if a MASK already exists it will be
       removed during the execution of this program.


       The cell values in the image bands cannot fall outside of the range  of
       0 to 255.  _i_._c_l_a_s_s will report an error if they do.


       _i_._c_l_a_s_s,  like  some  of  the  other imagery programs, does not use the
       standard GRASS display frames.  After running _i_._c_l_a_s_s, you will need to
       create  a display frame (e.g., using _d_._f_r_a_m_e or _d_._e_r_a_s_e) before you can
       use most of the GRASS display (d.) commands.


       _i_._g_r_o_u_p must be run before _i_._c_l_a_s_s to create an  imagery  group  and  a
       subgroup containing the image bands to be classified.


       The  user  can  perform  a  supervised  image classification by running
       _i_._c_l_a_s_s followed by _i_._m_a_x_l_i_k.  The user  can  perform  an  unsupervised
       classification by running _i_._c_l_u_s_t_e_r followed by _i_._m_a_x_l_i_k.


       _i_._c_l_a_s_s  is  interactive  and  requires no command line arguments.  The
       user must be running a graphics display monitor (see _d_._m_o_n) to run this
       program.
