       pixel resolution of the CURRENTLY DEFINED REGION.

       This program converts a GRASS raster file to a PPM image  file  at  the
       pixel  resolution  of  the  CURRENTLY DEFINED REGION.  e.g., to get the
       resolution of the raster map, do:


       g.region rast=[mapname]


       before running r.out.ppm.


       The PPM file created is 24bit color, rawbits storage by default.  Using
       -G,  you  may  force  r.out.ppm  to  use  8bit  greyscale instead.  The
       greyscale conversion uses the NTSC conversion:


       Y = .30*Red + .59*Green + .11*Blue


       One pixel is written for each cell value, so if ew_res and ns_res  dif-
       fer, the aspect ratio of the resulting image will be off.



NNOOTTEE
       A  few  ppm  file  comments  are written - the name of the GRASS raster
       file, resolution, etc.  Although these are perfectly legal, I've  found
       one  PD image utility that chokes on them, so if you need a commentless
       ppm file, use out=- > outfile.ppm. (When sending output to  stdout,  no
       comments are written.)
