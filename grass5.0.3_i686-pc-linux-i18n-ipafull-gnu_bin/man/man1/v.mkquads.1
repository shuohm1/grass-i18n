       There are three types  of  output  available  from  the  GRASS  program
       _v_._m_k_q_u_a_d_s:

              a  vector  map  of  all  the full USGS quadrangles that will fit
              within the boundaries of the current geographic region.

              a GRASS sites list containing the corner coordinates of each  of
              these quads.

              GRASS geographic region definition files associated with each of
              the quads created.



       A _q_u_a_d is defined as the area covered by a USGS  7.5-minute  (1:24,000)
       map.   This  program  is useful for managing a GRASS data base LOCATION
       which contains a number of quads which are to be patched together.



   FFllaaggss::
       --ee     Encompass current geographic region with quads (rather than only
              creating  those quads that lie inside of the geographic region).
              Use of this option will affect all output options.

       --ss     Create a GRASS sites list file.  The sites list will contain all
              the  corner  coordinates of all the full quads that can be built
              in the current geographic region.  The sites list file can  then
              be displayed using the _d_._s_i_t_e_s program.

       --rr     Create  region file(s): quad.1 quad.2 ...  The program will gen-
              erate a separate geographic  region  definition  file  for  each
              quad;  each of the geographic region files created will have the
              prefix _q_u_a_d_.  with some number attached to it.  For example,  if
              only  one  quad  were created, the geographic region file _q_u_a_d_._1
              would also be created in the _w_i_n_d_o_w_s directory under the  user's
              current mapset.  To make the program-generated geographic region
              definition file _q_u_a_d_._1 your _c_u_r_r_e_n_t geographic  region  setting,
              run the GRASS _g_._r_e_g_i_o_n program.

       --vv     Create  vector file (default).  Only full quads will be created.
              The binary vector map layer output is placed  under  the  user's
              _d_i_g  directory  and can be used like any other vector map layer.
              Run _v_._s_u_p_p_o_r_t to build the topology information for  the  vector
              map before using _v_._m_k_q_u_a_d_s map layer outputs in the _v_._d_i_g_i_t pro-
              gram.  Since the quads are computer-generated, the corner  coor-
              dinates  will  be  exact.   This simplifies digitizing if one or
              more quad sheets will have to be brought  together  for  a  data
              base, because all of the quad corner points to be joined will be
              guaranteed to match.

       --xx     Create a GRASS registration (_r_e_g) file.




   PPaarraammeetteerr::
       mmaapp==_n_a_m_e
              The name of a file to contain program output.

           options: full,third,quarter,1x1,1x2

           default: full



       If the user runs _v_._m_k_q_u_a_d_s without including  program  parameter  value
       and desired flags on the command line, the program will prompt the user
       for the above information using the standard GRASS interface  described
       in the manual entry for _p_a_r_s_e_r.

NNOOTTEESS
       All output options can be used on the command line at the same time.  A
       listing of all the quad  points  in  latitude/longitude  and  projected
       coordinates will be displayed each time the program is executed.

BBUUGGSS
       There  are  no  guarantees  that  _v_._m_k_q_u_a_d_s will function properly if a
       quadrangle crosses UTM zones.  This program has not been tested outside
       the northwest UTM quadrant.
