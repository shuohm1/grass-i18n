       _s_._c_e_l_l_s_t_a_t_s  calculates  univariate  statistics of sites lists for each
       cluster of input sites falling within each cell of the current  region.
       This  includes  the  number of sites, mean, standard deviation, coeffi-
       cient of variation, mininum, first quartile,  median,  third  quartile,
       and maximum.  The output is a sites list where the coordinates are cell
       centers, the category is the count of sites falling  within  the  cell,
       and  the  decimal attributes are the statistics.  Sites falling outside
       the current region are discarded.

       oouuttppuutt==_n_a_m_e
              Name of the output sites file.  If not  specified,  the  program
              writes to standard output.

       ffiieelldd==_v_a_l_u_e

       mmiinn==_v_a_l_u_e
              Set  a  minimum  sample  size per cell.  If there are fewer than
              _v_a_l_u_e sites found for a given cell, statistics  are  not  calcu-
              lated for that cell.

              Specify which statistics should be reported.  Statistics will be
              reported in the order specified, otherwise they  are  output  in
              the order below.  The statistics are:

              _m   - mean

              _s   - standard deviation

              _c_v  - coefficient of variation

              _s_k_w - skewness

              _k_u_r - kurtosis

              _m_s_e - mean of squares

              _m_a_v - mean of absolute values

              _m_i_n - minimum

              _q_1  - first quartile

              _m_e_d - median

              _q_3  - third quartile

              _m_a_x - maximum

              _s_u_m - sum

              _n   - number of sites in the sample

       Requires  at  least  16  bytes of memory per input site plus some other
       overhead.  Very large input sites files may cause excessive  swap  file
       usage or cause the program to fail with an out of memory error.


       Certain  statistics  are  invalid  when  calculated  for a single site.
       These statistics are the standard deviation, coefficient of  variation,
       skewness  and  kurtosis.   The  _m_i_n parameter may be used to insure the
       sample size is large enough to  approximate  normality.   Additionally,
       the  cell  size  for the current region may be enlarged to capture more
       sites per cell.  No test for normality is performed on  the  input  and
       some statistics may not be valid if normality is violated.
