       _r_._s_u_r_f_._c_o_n_t_o_u_r creates a raster elevation map from a rasterized contour
       map.   Elevation  values  are  determined using procedures similar to a
       manual methods.  To determine the elevation of a  point  on  a  contour
       map,  an  individual  might interpolate its value from those of the two
       nearest contour lines (uphill and downhill).


       _r_._s_u_r_f_._c_o_n_t_o_u_r works in a similar way.  Initially, a vector map of  the
       contour lines is made with the elevation of each line as its label (see
       _v_._d_i_g_i_t ).  When the program _v_._t_o_._r_a_s_t is run on the vector  map,  con-
       tinuous  "lines"  of rasters containing the contour line values will be
       the input for _r_._s_u_r_f_._c_o_n_t_o_u_r. For each cell in the  input  map,  either
       the cell is a contour line cell (which is given that value), or a flood
       fill is generated from that spot until the fill  comes  to  two  unique
       values.  So  the  _r_._s_u_r_f_._c_o_n_t_o_u_r  linearly interpolates between contour
       lines. The flood fill is not allowed to cross over the rasterized  con-
       tour  lines,  thus  ensuring  that an uphill and downhill contour value
       will be the two values chosen.  _r_._s_u_r_f_._c_o_n_t_o_u_r  interpolates  from  the
       uphill and downhill values by the true distance.


       The  program  will  be  run non-interactively if the user specifies the
       program parameter values and desired flag settings on the command line,
       using the form:


       rr..ssuurrff..ccoonnttoouurr [--ff] iinnppuutt==_n_a_m_e oouuttppuutt==_n_a_m_e



       Alternately,  the  user  can  simply type rr..ssuurrff..ccoonnttoouurr on the command
       line, without program arguments.   In  this  case,  the  user  will  be
       prompted  for needed inputs and option choices using the standard GRASS
       user interface described in the manual entry for _p_a_r_s_e_r .

       iinnppuutt==_n_a_m_e
              Name of an existing raster map layer that contains a set of ini-
              tial  category  values  (i.e., some cells contain known category
              values (denoting contours) while the rest contain zeros (0)).

       oouuttppuutt==_n_a_m_e
              Name to be assigned to new output raster map layer  that  repre-
              sents  a  smooth  (e.g.,  elevation)  surface generated from the
              known category values in the input raster map layer.

       _r_._s_u_r_f_._c_o_n_t_o_u_r works well under the  following  circumstances:  1)  the
       contour lines extend to the the edge of the current region, 2) the pro-
       gram is run at the same resolution as that of the input map,  3)  there
       are  no disjointed contour lines, and 4) no spot elevation data BETWEEN
       contour lines exist.  Spot elevations at the tops of hills and the bot-
       toms  of  depressions,  on  the other hand, improve the output greatly.
       Violating these  constraints  will  cause  non-intuitive  anomalies  to
       appear in the output map.  Run _r_._s_l_o_p_e_._a_s_p_e_c_t
        on _r_._s_u_r_f_._c_o_n_t_o_u_r results to locate potential anomalies.


       The  running  of  _r_._s_u_r_f_._c_o_n_t_o_u_r is very sensitive to the resolution of
       rasterized vector map.  If multiple contour lines go through  the  same
       raster,  slight  anomalies  may  occur.  The speed of _r_._s_u_r_f_._c_o_n_t_o_u_r is
       dependent on how far "apart" the contour lines are from each other  (as
       measured  in  rasters).  Since a flood fill algorithm is used, the pro-
       gram's running time will grow exponentially with the  distance  between
       contour lines.
