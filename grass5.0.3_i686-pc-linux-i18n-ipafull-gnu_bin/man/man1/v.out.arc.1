       _v_._o_u_t_._a_r_c is a GRASS data export program that converts files  in  GRASS
       vector format to ARC/INFO's "Generate" file format.  The companion pro-
       gram _v_._i_n_._a_r_c imports data in ARC/INFO's "Generate" format and converts
       them to GRASS vector format.


       This program can be run either non-interactively or interactively.  The
       program will be run non-interactively if the user  specifies  parameter
       values on the command line using the following format:


       vv..oouutt..aarrcc ttyyppee==_n_a_m_e vveecctt==_n_a_m_e aarrcc__pprreeffiixx==_n_a_m_e



       Alternately, the user can simply type:


       vv..oouutt..aarrcc



       on  the  command  line;  in this case, the program will prompt the user
       for parameter values.

       _v_._o_u_t_._a_r_c will prompt the user to enter the name of a GRASS vector file
       to be exported to ARC/INFO and for a filename prefix to be used in nam-
       ing the files created by the program.


       A GRASS vector file to be exported to ARC/INFO must either contain only
       linear  features  (i.e.,  have only line coverage) or contain only area
       edge features (i.e., have only polygon coverage).  _v_._o_u_t_._a_r_c will begin
       by  asking  the  user which type of coverage (line or polygon) is to be
       imported:
            COVERAGE TYPE
            Enter "polygon" or "line"
            Hit RETURN to cancel request
            >

       The program then prompts the user for the name of the GRASS vector file
       to be converted to ARC/INFO format:
            VECTOR (DIGIT) FILENAME
            Enter 'list' for a list of existing binary vector files
            Hit RETURN to cancel request
            >

       Next, the user is asked for a file-name prefix to be used in naming the
       output ARC/INFO Generate format files:
            ARC/INFO (GENERATE) FILENAME PREFIX
            Hit RETURN to cancel request
            >

       The filename prefix will be used to name the various files that will be
       created for export to ARC/INFO.  When labeled polygon coverage data are
       exported, three such files will be created:  a _l_i_n_e_s _f_i_l_e with the suf-
       fix  .lin,  a  _l_a_b_e_l_-_p_o_i_n_t_s _f_i_l_e with the suffix .lab, and a _l_a_b_e_l_-_t_e_x_t
       _f_i_l_e with the suffix .txt.  When line coverage data are  exported,  two
       such  files  will  be created: a _l_i_n_e_s _f_i_l_e with the suffix .lin, and a
       _l_a_b_e_l_-_t_e_x_t _f_i_l_e with the suffix .txt.  Export of unlabeled  polygon  or
       line  coverage  data will result in creation of a _l_i_n_e_s _f_i_l_e (.lin suf-
       fix) only. All exported files are stored in the current directory.

       See the DATA FILE FORMATS section for more information on these  files.





EEXXAAMMPPLLEE
       Linear  features  and  polygon  data  are made up of the series of arcs
       (aka, vectors) outlining their perimeters.  The _A_R_C_/_I_N_F_O _U_s_e_r_s_'  _G_u_i_d_e,
       in  its  discussion  of  the  _U_n_g_e_n_e_r_a_t_e command, explains how line and
       polygon coverage data can be created from files  (like  _p_r_e_f_i_x_._l_i_n  and
       _p_r_e_f_i_x_._p_o_l)  containing  the  geographic coordinates of these arcs, and
       from files (like _p_r_e_f_i_x_._l_a_b) containing the geographic  coordinates  of
       label-points.   Below  is  an  example  which illustrates the creation,
       within ARC/INFO, of a polygon coverage data file (named _s_o_i_l_s) from the
       files _s_o_i_l_s_._p_o_l and _s_o_i_l_s_._l_a_b.
          Arc: GENERATE SOILS
          Generate: INPUT soils.pol
          Generate: LINES
          Generating lines ...
          Generate: INPUT soils.lab
          Generate: POINTS
          Generating points ...
          Generate: QUIT
          Arc: _

       The above example would create a polygon coverage data file named _s_o_i_l_s
       with label-points.  The label-points would have ID numbers that  corre-
       spond  to  the  GRASS category values for the polygons in the coverage.
       The INFO portion of ARC/INFO can be used to associate these label-point
       ID numbers with descriptive text from the _s_o_i_l_s_._t_x_t file.

       This  text file is a "Generate" format lines file.  The _l_i_n_e_s option of
       the ARC/INFO _G_e_n_e_r_a_t_e command can  be  used  to  read  this  file  into
       ARC/INFO.  Each line in the file has a unique line-ID number.

       LABEL-POINTS FILE, also known as _p_r_e_f_i_x_._l_a_b file:
       This  text  file  will be created by _v_._o_u_t_._a_r_c if the vector file being
       exported represents a polygon coverage.  _p_r_e_f_i_x_._l_a_b consists of a  list
       of  label-point  (x,y)  coordinates,  each with a unique label-point ID
       number.

       LABEL-TEXT FILE, also known as _p_r_e_f_i_x_._t_x_t file:
       In the case of polygon coverage data, this file associates  an  integer
       category value and a category label ("attribute") text string (contain-
       ing no spaces) with each label-point ID number.  In the  case  of  line
       coverage  data,  this  file associates an integer category value and an
       attribute text string with each line-ID number.


       The first column is the row number (which  is  arbitrary),  the  second
       column  contains the category value, the third column holds the line or
       label-point ID number, and the fourth  column  contains  the  attribute
       text string.
