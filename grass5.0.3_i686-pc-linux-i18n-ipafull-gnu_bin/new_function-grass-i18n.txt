GRASS i18n new fcunction

Internationalized(i18n) functions:

(1)the menu of tcltkgrass(tcltkgrass-i18n)
The menu of tcltkgrass which is the GUI of GRASS was internationalized.
Tcltkgrass of the i18n version consists of "tcltkgrass-i18n" new
command and modules include message catalogue(ja.msg, en.msg).
Depending on the locale (LANG) environment, tcltkgras can be displayed 
in both Japanese(EUC-JP, SJIS,UTF-8) and English (LANG=C).

Usage:

1.start GRASS
 $ grass5

2.start tcltkgrass-i18n
 GRASS:~>tcltkgrass-i18n&

note)
tcltkgrass-i18n needs mlterm. You must install mlterm before GRASS
installation.

(2)command help
"command help" which is main help for the commands of GRASS was 
internationalized. The command help dialog box can be displayed in
tcltkgrass by clicking the right button of the mouse over a menu item
or on a "RUN" (execute) button of a comman dialog.
Command help can be invoked also in a shell by typing the following:

 GRASS~>command help

(3)the text on the GRASS monitor
The text (character strings)displayed on the GRASS monitor was 
internatinalized. Internationalization does not use vector fonts
simillar to the original version, but instead uses TrueType fonts which
enables the display of Double Byte characters such as Japanese character 
set. To set up TrueType fonts a new command "d.font.freetype"
has been added to perform font and character encodings.
This internationalization can now display Japanese and other language 
text from site labels, legends, etc.

Usage:

1.to enable to display a TrueType font on the monitor
 GRASS:~>d.mon start x0
 GRASS:~>d.font.freetype [font=TrueTypefontname] [charset=encoding]
 
 [font]:TrueType font path(full path include font file name)
 [charset]:character encoding(EUC-JP,UTF-8,SJIS)
 ex.)Redhat Linux9
 GRASS:~>d.font.freetype font=/usr/share/fonts/ja/TrueType/kochi-gothic.ttf charset=EUC-JP
 
2.to disable to display a TrueType font on the monitor
 GRASS:~>d.font.freetype font=

note)
Font option such as d.site.labels command are ignored 
if you select a TrueType font.
