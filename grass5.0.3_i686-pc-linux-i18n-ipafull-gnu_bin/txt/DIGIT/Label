 
   Label Menu
 
   This menu has several tools for labeling a
 digitized map.  It is available by pressing 
 'L' (shift-L) any time Label is shown in the
 global menu.  All options are available with
 or without a digitizer enabled.
 
 To label an object, you will be asked for
 a category number.  This number will later be
 used to create cell values in vect.to.cell.
