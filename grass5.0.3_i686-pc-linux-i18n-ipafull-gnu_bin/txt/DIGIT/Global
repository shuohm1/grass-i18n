   Top Level    Global Menu

 The Global menu is almost always available
 at the bottom of the screen.  To select an
 item, simply type the first letter of your 
 choice.  Note that it must be in upper-case.

 These commands will take you to other menus:
     Digitize    Edit     Label
     Customize   Window   Toolbox
 While these will cause an immediate action:
     Help   Zoom   Quit  *  !  ^
