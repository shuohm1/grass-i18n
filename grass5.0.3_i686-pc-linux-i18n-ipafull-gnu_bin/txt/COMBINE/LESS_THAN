LESS-THAN - command

The LESS-THAN "<" command tells COMBINE to take input from the following
named file.  When that file is exhausted, you regain control at the 
keyboard.

EXAMPLES:

Where "input" is any name of a file that you have created that contains 
commands for combine.  This file may be created from within "combine" by
running an editor:   !vi input
