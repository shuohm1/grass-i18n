EXCLAM - command

The EXCLAMATION POINT (!) is a "shell-escape".  It allows you to
run a shell command or gis command WITHOUT leaving combine.

syntax: ! command

EXAMPLES:
  ! list cell  List the cell files currently accessible.
  ! vi input   (Where "input" is a word of your choice). Edits the file
                   "input".  Often useful for creating complex requests to
                   combine.   Combine can then use this input with the
                   command "< input".
  ! whoami     Useful for finding out who is using the terminal when you
                   need it.
