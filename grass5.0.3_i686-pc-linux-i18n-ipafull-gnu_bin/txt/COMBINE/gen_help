                COMBINE general help facility

COMBINE is a language driven GRASS analysis tool.  

You can locate landscape sites which meet your criteria using the boolean
keywords AND and OR, and the grouping command GROUP.

Other keywords extract information from the data base, create new maps,
and overlay analysis results.

For help with any combine command, type help followed by the command name.
    For example:  help TOPIC

where TOPIC is one of the following:
    syntax         MAP_NAME   RANGE         HISTORY
    example1       AND        WINDOW        ERASE
    example2       OR         CATEGORIES    HELP 
                   GROUP      OVER          QUIT
                   NOT        COVER
