geographic region - A rectangular area (region), stated in the
\map coordinate system\ of the GRASS location under which the region
is stored, whose sides are parallel to the coordinate axes.  A geo-
graphic region also has an east-west \resolution\ and a north-south
resolution associated with it, which specify the dimensions used
by individual \cells\ falling within the region's boundaries.

NOTE: In earlier versions of GRASS, the term "geographic window" was
used to denote a geographic region.
