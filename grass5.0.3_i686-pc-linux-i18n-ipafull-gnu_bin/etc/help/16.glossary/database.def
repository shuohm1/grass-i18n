database - A collection of data sets stored together and controlled
by a specific schema.  A consistent and specified set of procedures
is used in adding data to a database and in changing or retrieving
existing data from it.  A GIS database includes data about the
positions and the attributes associated with geographic features that
have been coded as points, lines or areas.

In GRASS, the term database refers to the UNIX directory in which the
user's GRASS data are stored on a computer.  The variable $GISDBASE
is also used to refer to this directory.
