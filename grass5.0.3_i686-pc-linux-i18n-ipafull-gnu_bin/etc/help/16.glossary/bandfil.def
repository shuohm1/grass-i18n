band file - A digital file depicting a remotely-sensed \image\ in
terms of spectral reflectance values within some specific \band\
on the electromagnetic spectrum.  LANDSAT Thematic Mapper (TM)
images typically represent data in each of the seven bands, while
LANDSAT Multispectral Scanner (MSS) images contain four bands of
data and \SPOT\ color images offer three bands of data.  Panchromatic
images represent data in terms of a single band.
