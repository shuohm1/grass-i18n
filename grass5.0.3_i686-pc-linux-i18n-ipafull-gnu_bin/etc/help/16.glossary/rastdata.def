raster data (raster format) - A data format whose basic unit is the
grid cell.  Data are stored on a grid containing rectangular \cells\
of uniform size.  Cell dimensions denote data resolution.  Each cell
within the grid can be assigned a data value.  Smaller grid cell size
therefore allows more data to be stored for a given geographic \area\
(i.e., can present data at a larger \scale\).  See \vector data\ for
comparison.
