join - Typically refers to the connection of two or more digital
maps containing data for different (often adjacent) geographic
\regions\.  Such maps may originally have been \digitized\
separately due to digitizer size limits.  Sometimes, join refers to
the joining of digital data (e.g., two line segments) within a map.
