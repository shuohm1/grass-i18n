digit file - A file storing map data in GRASS \vector format\ and
usable by the GRASS program \v.digit\.  Within a mapset, binary GRASS
vector data are stored under the dig directory and ASCII GRASS vector
data are stored under the dig_ascii directory.  Category (attribute)
values and labels associated with the data in the digit file are stored
in separate files, under the dig_att and dig_cats directories.

NOTE: "Digit file" was the name used for vector map data files in
previous releases of GRASS.  A "digit file" is now referred to as
a "vector file" in all GRASS 4.0 documentation.
