location - A directory containing the GRASS mapsets accessible by a
user within a given GRASS session.  All mapsets stored under the same
GRASS location must use the same \map coordinate system\.  Typically,
each GRASS location stores mapsets whose data are referenced to the
same geographic region on the earth's surface.  Each location directory
contains the special \mapset\ "PERMANENT" and other user mapsets.
The variable $LOCATION_NAME denotes the user's current GRASS location.
