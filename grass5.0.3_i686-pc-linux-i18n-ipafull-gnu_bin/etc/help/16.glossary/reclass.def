reclass - To recategorize the tagged \attributes\ (category values)
in a map.  The function is commonly used to create new maps (e.g.,
reclassing a map of soil mapping units into a map of soil
permeabilities) or to reduce the level of detail (e.g., reclassing
a map of true elevation values into a map of elevation ranges).
