search path - In GRASS, users may access maps, created by others,
that are stored in \mapsets\ under the same geographic \location\.
The user can specify the names and order in which mapsets will be
searched for maps in his mapset search path.  More generally, in
\UNIX\ terminology, a search path specifies the names of and order
in which directories will be searched for user-specified files and
programs.
