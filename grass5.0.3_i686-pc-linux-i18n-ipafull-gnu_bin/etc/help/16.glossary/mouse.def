mouse - The most commonly used device to point to a position on the
graphics display monitor.  Other devices may include light pens,
touch screens, or graphics tablets.  If your hardware configuration
includes one of these latter pointing devices, read the term "mouse"
to mean whichever pointing device your graphics monitor uses.

NOTE:  Special drivers must be written to support the use of a
pointing device other than a mouse with GRASS.
