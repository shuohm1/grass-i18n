mapset - A directory in which GRASS database \elements\ are stored.
At the start of each GRASS session, the user must specify a current
mapset ($MAPSET), current location ($LOCATION_NAME), and current
database ($GISDBASE).  Any maps created or modified by the user in
the current GRASS session will be stored in the user's current mapset.
The user may also access data stored in other mapsets under the same
GRASS location as the current mapset.  All mapsets stored under the
same location directory refer to the same general geographic region,
and must use the same map coordinate system.

A special mapset (named 'PERMANENT') is stored under each location
directory; it contains some files used by all mapsets under that
location (e.g., those specifying a default \geographic region\, the
name of the geographic location, the location's \map coordinate system\,
etc.), and commonly also contains standard maps needed by many
applications.
