raster file - (aka, cell file in earlier releases of GRASS).  The
\digital\ data file in which \raster map data\ are stored in GRASS.
Each data file describes a specific thematic map in terms of its 
geographic coordinates.  Supporting files describe the category
values, labels, map title, history, etc., corresponding to this
raster data file.  All of the files relating to a given raster data
file are collectively termed a raster map layer.
