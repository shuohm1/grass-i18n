Data Base Management System (DBMS) - A systematic approach to 
maintaining, accessing and manipulating \files\ stored in a \database\.
A DBMS may consist of a single program or a collection of task-
specific programs.  GRASS contains programs which allow it to be
interfaced with several existing DBMS.  Typically, DBMS allow the
user to manipulate and store multiple pieces of information (data)
for a single point.
