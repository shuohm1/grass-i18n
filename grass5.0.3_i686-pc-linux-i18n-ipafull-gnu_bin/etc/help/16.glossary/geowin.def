geographic window - A rectangular region, stated in the
\map coordinate system\ of the user's current GRASS location, whose
sides are parallel to the coordinate axes.  A geographic window also
has an east-west \resolution\ and a north-south resolution associated
with it, which specify the dimensions assumed by \cells\ within the
geographic window.

NOTE:  This term is now obsolete.  Geographic windows are referred to
as "geographic regions" in GRASS version 4.0.
