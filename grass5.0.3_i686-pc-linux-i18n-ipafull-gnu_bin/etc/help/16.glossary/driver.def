driver - A program which directly interfaces a computer's software with
a hardware device (like a \graphics monitor\, printer, or \digitizer\)
and handles requests made to that hardware device by the software.
GRASS provides drivers to enable specific graphics monitors, \raster\
output devices, \digitizing\ tablets and other peripherals to be used
for GRASS input and output.  Users can also write their own drivers to
allow other peripheral devices to be used for GRASS input and output.
