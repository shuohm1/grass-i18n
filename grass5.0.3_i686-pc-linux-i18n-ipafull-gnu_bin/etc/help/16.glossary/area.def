area - A homogeneous region containing data having the same 
\category value\.  An area (a.k.a., \polygon\) is formed by the series
of \arcs\ outlining its perimeter.  GRASS vector format does not
store polygons explicitly; when used to describe \vector data\, 
therefore, areas refer to area edges.  More generally, area can refer 
to a geographically defined region (rather than to a region defined by 
a category value).
