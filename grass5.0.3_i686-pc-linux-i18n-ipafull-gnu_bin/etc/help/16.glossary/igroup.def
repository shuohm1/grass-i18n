i.group

i.group is an imagery program that allows the user to group any
of the raster imagery files that are present in the current
\location\ and currently selected mapset into:

	1.  a subgroup of the first group created during
	    the tape extraction,

	2.  a new imagery group, and subsequently, a subgroup
	    of a new imagery group,

	3.  an already existing group in the current location
	    and mapset, and subsequently, a subgroup of an
	    already existing group.

i.group also allows the user to remove raster imagery files from
a group in his or her mapset.  Raster files, however, cannot be
removed from, or added to, existing subgroups.  If a new subgroup
is needed, the procedure recommended is to create a new subgroup.

i.group is able to offer its options to all of the raster imagery
files in the mapsets that were selected using the GRASS command
\g.mapsets\.  i.group, however, is restricted to the files and
selected mapsets in the user's current GRASS location.
