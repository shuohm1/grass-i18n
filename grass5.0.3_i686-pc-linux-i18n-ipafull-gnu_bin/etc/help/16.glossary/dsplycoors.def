display coordinate system - An x,y coordinate system based on the
user's graphics monitor (display device).  Some GRASS programs use
this coordinate system, rather than a map coordinate system, to
specify where on the graphics monitor objects will be displayed.
Typically, x and y coordinate values are stated as percentages
of the display frame's (horizontal) width and (vertical) height,
measured from the frame's lower left corner.
