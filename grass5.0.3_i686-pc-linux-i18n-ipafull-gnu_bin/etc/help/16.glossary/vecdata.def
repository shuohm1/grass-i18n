vector data (vector format) - A data format in which area, linear,
and point features are represented and stored as the series of \arcs\
(a.k.a., vectors) forming their perimeters.  In GRASS, map data can 
be converted between vector and \raster\ data formats.  Typically,
data are \digitized\ in vector format and analyzed in their raster
format.  Data can be displayed and output in either format.
