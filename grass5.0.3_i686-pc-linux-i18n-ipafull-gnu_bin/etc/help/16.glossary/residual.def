residual - In map \registration\, a residual is the amount of error
that a registered \control point\ contributes to the overall map
registration error.  "Error" is defined as the difference between
the value assigned by the user to a control point and its expected
value based on a user-specified map coordinate system and the values
of the other registration control points.
