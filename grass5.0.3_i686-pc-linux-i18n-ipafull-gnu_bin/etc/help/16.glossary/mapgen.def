map generalization - The process of reducing the detail of spatial
features in a \map layer\.  Often undertaken in conjuction with
a reduction in \map scale\.  The process can be semi-automated for
certain kinds of data, such as \topographic\ features, but requires
more sensitive analysis for thematic maps.  See also \reclass\.
