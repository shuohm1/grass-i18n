             WELCOME TO THE GRASS ON-LINE HELP SYSTEM  

The GRASS On-Line Help System provides information about GRASS and
its many capabilities.  Information is organized under "topic areas"
which categorize GRASS commands by their specific application within
GRASS.  Each area provides you general information about a topic
(i.e., map development).  You then have the option to explore the
topic further by accessing more specific information on the GRASS
commands which correspond to that topic. 

The Help System also provides users with an on-line glossary of the
most commonly used GIS and GRASS terms and an on-line version of the
GRASS User's Reference Manual.

Information is linked throughout the Help System, by the use of
\highlighted keywords\ or \text strings\ within the text.  By using 
the RETURN KEY, you can move from highlighted word to highlighted
word.  An asterisk (*) indicates the currently highlighted word. To
make a selection, simply press the SPACE BAR Key.     

The RETURN key and the ESCAPE key in the Help System perform the
same functions as within GRASS programs, thus reinforcing their
functionality.

To receive additional instructions on how to use this Help System,
use the RETURN KEY to move through the above highlighted words, then
press the SPACE BAR key to select the word.
