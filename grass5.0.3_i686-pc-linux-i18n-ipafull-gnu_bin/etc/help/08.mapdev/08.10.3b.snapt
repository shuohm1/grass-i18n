                     THE SNAPPING OF NODES

The geographic coordinates associated with digitized points (defining
line segments and nodes) will be added to a GRASS data file in the order
in which they are digitized.  If two node points fall within the
geographic snapping threshold of one another, the node that appears
second in the data file will snap to the one that is listed first.
In GRASS, the default snapping threshold is .04 map inches (in terms
of distance on the map).  The snapping threshold can also be expressed
as actual ground distance in database mapping units (e.g., in meters for
a UTM database).  When expressed in database mapping units, the number
given for the snapping threshold will be dependent on the scale of the map.

Please refer to \Setting the Snapping Threshold Value\ for important
information on setting the snapping threshold.
