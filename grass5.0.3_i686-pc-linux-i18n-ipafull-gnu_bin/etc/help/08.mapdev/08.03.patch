                    EDITING AND PATCHING MAP DATA

Frequently, (due to the size of digitizing tablets) users \digitize\
data in relatively small chunks which must be "patched" together before
data are analyzed.  The GRASS commands listed below can be used to edit
and patch digital data.  Prefixes denote whether commands operate on
data in vector ("v.") or raster ("r.") file format.

              \-  v.patch \        \-  r.patch \
              \-  v.prune \        \-  r.mapcalc \
              \-  v.spag \

For more information on a specific command, select a command and press
ESC.
