                          SUPPORTED DIGITIZERS

Currently, USACERL supports software linking GRASS with the following
digitizers:

              \ Altek \
              \ CalComp \
              \ Kurta \
                Numonics
                Geographics
                Hitachi
                none    --  (for on-screen digitizing)

For more specific information on the digitizers listed above, select
one from the list and press ESC.

Some users have written their own software that enable GRASS to be used
with other digitizers.  Such software is referred to as a \device driver\.
The \GRASS Information Center\ at USACERL maintains a partial listing of
digitizers and other peripherals being used by other GRASS user sites.
This list is available upon request.  Users can also write their own
device drivers.  Some help for doing this is available on-line in the
directories under $GISBASE/src/mapdev/digitizers and in the
\"GRASS Programmer's Manual"\ (Shapiro et al., 1989).
