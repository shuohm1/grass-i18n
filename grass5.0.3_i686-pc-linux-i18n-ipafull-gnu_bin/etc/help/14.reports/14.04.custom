                    CUSTOMIZING REPORTS

GRASS programs like \r.report\, \r.coin\, and \s.menu\ output their results
in the form of reports.  Options made available in GRASS 5.0 allow
the user added flexibility in designing the form of these reports.

Users can also use GRASS programs in combination with UNIX programs like
"awk", "sed", and "sort" to completely customize the formats of reports.

One sample use of "awk" with GRASS programs appears in the Winter/1989
issue of the newsletter \"GRASSClippings"\ (article by Fred Limp,
Vol 3, No 1, pp 14-16).  This script uses output from the \r.stats\
program to calculate a region's expected total annual crop yield
based on a raster map layer of estimated crop yield per soil type.
It is reproduced below using GRASS 5.0 command syntax.

r.stats -aq soil.yield.map | \\
awk '{sum+=$1*($2/100000)*2.47} END {print"Total Yield:",sum}'

When piping GRASS program outputs through other commands like "awk",
users should include the option to run GRASS commands quietly
(i.e., non-verbosely).  Frequently, this will be a -q option.
