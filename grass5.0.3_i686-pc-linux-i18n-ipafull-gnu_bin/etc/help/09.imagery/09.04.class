One of the methods of deriving information from \digital imagery\
is multispectral classification.  Multispectral classification
analyzes the spectral reflectance values of pixels in an image.
Pixels, or picture elements, are the \cells\ that make up an image.
The word "pixel" is usually used in reference to a cell when it
is displayed on a computer monitor, but it is also often used to
refer to the cell in a stored digital image that we cannot see until
it is displayed.  In raw spectral digital imagery each cell has
a digital number (DN) or spectral reflectance value ranging from 0 to
255.  These are grouped into clusters or categories during image
classification that can be interpreted to represent features on the
surface of the earth.

There are many methods of multispectral classification, but generally
they fall into three groups:

	-  supervised classification
	-  unsupervised classification
	-  combinations of supervised and unsupervised classification

GRASS 4.0 supports supervised and unsupervised classification.  Both
types of classification require a two-step procedure.  The
two GRASS programs that create a supervised classified image are:

	\-  i.class \
	\-  i.maxlik \

Both programs must be run to complete a supervised classification.

The two programs that create an unsupervised image are:

	\-  i.cluster \
	\-  i.maxlik \

As with a supervised classification, both programs must be run to
complete an unsupervised classification.

Other GRASS programs which can be used in the image classification
process are:

	\-  i.cca \
	\-  i.pca \
	\-  i.zc \
	\-  r.mapcalc \
