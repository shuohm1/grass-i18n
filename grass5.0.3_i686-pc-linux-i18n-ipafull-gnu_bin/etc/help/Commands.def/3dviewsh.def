3d.view.sh - 

3d.view.sh is a Bourne shell script that displays several 3-dimensional
views of a landscape on the user's graphics monitor.  It erases the
graphics monitor and then prepares it for the display of nine
equally-sized frames.  The user-specified \raster map\ layer is
displayed using \d.rast\ in the middle frame.  The remaining frames are
then used to display 3-d perspective views.
