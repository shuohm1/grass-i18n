d.mapgraph - 

d.mapgraph draws graphics that are described in standard input (default)
or the \UNIX\ filename.  This program essentially performs the same
functions as \d.graph\; however, point locations are specified to
d.mapgraph in the geographic coordinate system of the user's current
\mapset\ and \location\ rather than in graphics display screen
coordinates.
