i.composite - 

i.composite is an imagery function that creates a color composite
image from three \band files\ specified by the user.  The user
specifies the bands to be used by assigning the bands a red, blue or
green intensity.  The resulting image is a single \raster\ file
composed of the three bands that were selected.  The color composite
can be displayed, plotted or manipulated as would any raster file
in GRASS. 

This program can be used to create a false color composite.  A false
color composite is the color asssignment that is used in infrared
photography.  The green band is assigned shades of the primary color
blue, the red band is assigned shades of the primary color green and
the near infrared band is assigned shades of the primary color red.

A good use for the color composite is in the program \i.points\, which
allows the user to locate points on an image to be \rectified\.  When
using i.points, if an image is not \classified\ before it is rectified,
the only imagery files available on which to locate and mark points may
be single band files.  These are displayed in grey scale color scheme
only.  When color may enhance the ability to locate points on a image
to be rectified, a color composite image can be displayed and marked to
provide this advantage.
