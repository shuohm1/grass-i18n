r.profile - 

r.profile prints, in ASCII format, the values in a \raster\ map which
lie along one or more lines.  The lines are described by their starting
and ending coordinates.  The profiles may be single-cell wide lines or
multiple-cell wide lines.  The output, for each profile, may be the
values at each of the \cells\ or a single aggregate value (e.g.,
average or median value).
