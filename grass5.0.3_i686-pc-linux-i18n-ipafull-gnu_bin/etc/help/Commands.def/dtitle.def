d.title - 

d.title generates to standard output a string which can be used by
\d.text\ to draw a title for the raster map layer in the active display
\frame\ on the graphics monitor.  Output created by d.title can be
redirected into a file, or piped directly into d.text to display the
map title created by d.title.  The title created will include the map
layer's name, title, \mapset\, \location\, \geographic region\ boundary
coordinates and cell \resolution\.
