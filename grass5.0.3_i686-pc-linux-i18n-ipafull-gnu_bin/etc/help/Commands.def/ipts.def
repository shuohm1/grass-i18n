i.points -

i.points enables the user to mark coordinate system points on an
\image\ to be rectified and then input the coordinates of each point
for calculation of a transformation matrix.  i.points must be followed
by \i.rectify\ which rectifies the image using the transformation
matrix coefficients calculated in i.points.  \i.target\ must be run
before i.points to enable the 'plot cell' option to be used and to
identify the database LOCATION in which the rectified image will be
deposited following i.rectify.
