r.in.ll - 

r.in.ll converts \raster\ data referenced using latitude and longitude
coordinates to a \UTM\-referenced map layer in GRASS raster format.
r.in.ll is primarily used as the final program in converting \DTED\
and \DEM\ digital elevation data to GRASS raster format, but is not
limited to this use.  The program uses the user's current
\geographic region\ settings.  Only data that falls within the current
geographic region will appear in the final raster map layer.
