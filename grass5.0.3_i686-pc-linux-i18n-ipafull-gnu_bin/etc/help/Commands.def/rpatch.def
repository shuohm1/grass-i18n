r.patch

r.patch allows the user to assign known data values from other
\raster\ \map layers\ to the "no data" areas (those assigned a
\category value\ of '0') in another raster map layer.  This program is
useful for making a composite raster map layer from two or more adjacent
map layers, for filling in "holes" in a raster map layer's data (e.g.,
in \digital\ elevation data), or for updating an older map layer with
more recent data.
