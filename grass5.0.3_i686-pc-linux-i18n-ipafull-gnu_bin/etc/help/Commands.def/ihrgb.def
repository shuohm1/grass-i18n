i.his.rgb - 

i.his.rgb is an image processing program that processes three input 
\raster\ \map layers\ as hue, intensity and saturation components and
produces three output raster map layers representing the red, green and
blue components of this data.  The output map layers are created by
standard hue-intensity-saturation (his) to red-green-blue (rgb) color
transformation.  Each output map layer is given a linear grey scale
color table.
