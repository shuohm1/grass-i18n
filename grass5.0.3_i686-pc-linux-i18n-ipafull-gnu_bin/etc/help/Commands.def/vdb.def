v.db - 

v.db allows the user to create, manipulate and query information about
labeled lines and areas from a number of different \vector\ maps in a
batch mode or \interactively\, with input in a command line style.
This program, like \s.db\, is actually a marriage of the GRASS
environment and the programmer's interface library of the relational
database management program RIM distributed publically by the
University of Washington Academic Computing Services.
