split.sh - 

split.sh is a Bourne shell script that clears the entire graphics
screen and divides it into two display \frames\.  Map layers are then
displayed in each of the two frames.  This command is very useful for
visually comparing maps (\raster\, \vector\ and 3-d views) and can be
used by other GRASS shell macros.  It is also useful for creating
demos.
