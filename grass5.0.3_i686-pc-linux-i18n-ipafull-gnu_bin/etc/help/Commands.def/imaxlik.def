i.maxlik - 

i.maxlik is a maximum likelihood discrminant analysis classifier.
It is the second pass in a two-pass procedure known as an unsuper-
vised classification.  The first pass in the unsupervised classification
is executed by the GRASS program \i.cluster\. 

The maximum likelihood classifer uses the cluster means and covariance
matrices from the i.cluster signature file and determines to which class
(or cluster) each pixel in the image has the highest probability of
belonging.  The resulting file is a classified image in which each
pixel has been assigned to a spectral class or category.  The spectral
classes can be related to specific land cover types on the ground.
