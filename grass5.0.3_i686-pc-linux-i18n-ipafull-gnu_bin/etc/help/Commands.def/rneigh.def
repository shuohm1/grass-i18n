r.neighbors - 

r.neighbors looks at each \cell\ in a \raster\ input file and examines
the \category values\ assigned to the cells in some user-defined
"neighborhood" around it.  It ouputs a new raster map layer in which
each cell is assigned a category value that is some (user-specified)
function of the values in that cell's neighborhood.
