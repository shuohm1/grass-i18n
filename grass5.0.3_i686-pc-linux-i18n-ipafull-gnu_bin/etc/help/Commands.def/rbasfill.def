r.basins.fill - 

r.basins.fill generates a \raster\ map layer depicting subbasins, based
on input raster map layers for the coded stream network (where each
channel segment has been "coded" with a unique \category value\ and
for the ridges within a given watershed.  The raster map layer
depicting ridges should include the ridge which defines the perimeter of
the watershed.  The coded stream network can be generated as part of
the \r.watershed\ program, but the map layer of ridges will need to be
created by digitizing using the \v.digit\ program.
