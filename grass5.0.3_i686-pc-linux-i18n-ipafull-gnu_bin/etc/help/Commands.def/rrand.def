r.random - 

r.random allows the user to create a \raster\ map layer and a \sites\
list file containing geographic coordinates of points whose locations
have been randomly determined.  The program locates these
randomly-generated sites within the current \geographic region\ and
\mask\, if any, on non-zero \category value\ data areas within a
user-specified raster map layer.
