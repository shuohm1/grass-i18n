m.ll2u - 

m.ll2u converts geographic coordinates (i.e., longitudes and latitudes)
to Universal Transverse Mercator (\UTM\) \eastings\ and \northings\.
The user must specify the spheroid on which to base the UTM conversion.
The user may optionally specify the \UTM zone\, however the program can
determine this from the geographic coordinates submitted.
