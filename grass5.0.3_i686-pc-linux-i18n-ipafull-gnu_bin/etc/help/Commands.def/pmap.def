p.map - 

p.map produces hardocopy color map products on a system's color output
device.  Output can include a \raster\ map, any number of \vector\
\overlays\, \site\ data, text labels and other spatial data.

This program has 2 distinct modes of operation.  The command-line mode
requires the user to prepare a file of mapping instructions describing
the various spatial and textual information to be printed prior to
running p.map.  The interactive mode (i.e., no command-line arguments)
will prompt the user for items to be mapped and does not require the
user to prepare a file of instructions.
