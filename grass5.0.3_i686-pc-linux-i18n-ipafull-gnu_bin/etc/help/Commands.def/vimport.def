v.import - 

v.import is an \interactive\ program which runs other \vector\ import
programs.  It allows the user to import \DLG\ or ASCII vector files and
ASCII vector files into binary vector files.  It also creates two
support files, the 'dig_plus' file and the 'dig_att' file (only created
when importing DLG files).  The 'dig_plus' file contains topological
information obtained by analyzing the vector file.  The 'dig-att' file
contains \category\ (attribute) information files by the labeling
function of the GRASS \v.digit\ program.  All of the above files must
be run through v.import before they can be used in the v.digit program.
