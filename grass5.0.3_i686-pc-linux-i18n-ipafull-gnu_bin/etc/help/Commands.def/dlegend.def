d.legend - 

d.legend displays a legend for a user-specified \raster\ map layer in
the active \frame\ on the graphics monitor.  The legend's size is based
on the height of the active frame.  The user should therefore take care
to create a display frame of suitable dimensions before running
d.legend.  d.legend will only obscure those portions of the active frame
that directly underlie the legend.
