i.rectify - 

i.rectify is the imagery function that rectifies an image by computing
a coordinate transformation for each pixel in the image using the
transformation coefficient matrix created by the GRASS program 
\i.points\.  i.rectify plugs the coefficients computed in i.points
into an equation and then converts x,y coordinates to standard map
coordinates for each pixel in the image.  The result is a planimetric
image with a transformed coordinate system.

i.points must be run before i.rectify and both programs are required
to rectifiy an image.  An image must be rectified before it can reside
in standard coordinate LOCATION, and therefore, be analyzed with
other \map layers\ in the standard coordinate LOCATION.  Upon
completion of i.rectify, the rectified image is deposited in the
target standard coordinate LOCATION.  This LOCATION is selected using
\i.target\.
