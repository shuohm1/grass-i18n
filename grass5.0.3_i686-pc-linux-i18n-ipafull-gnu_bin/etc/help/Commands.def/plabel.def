p.labels - 

This program allows the user to create or modify \labels\ files.  These
labels files, which are stored in the \database\, define text information
for printing with \p.map\ and for graphics display with
\d.paint.labels\.  Each label has components which determine the text,
the location of the text on the image, its size and the background for
the text.
