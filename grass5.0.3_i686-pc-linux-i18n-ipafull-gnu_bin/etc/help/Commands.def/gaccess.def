g.access - 

g.access allows the user to control access to the current \mapset\.
Normally, any user can read data from any GRASS mapset.  But sometimes
it is desirable to prohibit access to certain sensitive data.  The
g.access command allows a user to restrict read and execute access to
the current mapset.  It will not modify write access to the current
mapset.
