d.label - 

d.label allows the user to create and display text \labels\ in the
active \frame\ on the graphics monitor.  It \interactively\ requests
that the user type in text and use the pointing device (\mouse\) to
identify where this text is to be placed within the active graphics
frame.  The program will prompt the user for label size, background
color, text color, and text font type, if the user fails to specify
these values on the command line.
