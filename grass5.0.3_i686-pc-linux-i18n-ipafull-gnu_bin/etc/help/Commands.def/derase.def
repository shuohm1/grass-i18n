d.erase - 

d.erase erases the contents of the active \graphics display frame\ and
replaces it with the color black (by default) or by whatever color is
specified by the user.  Because d.erase replaces the contents of the
active display frame with a color, it will obscure those portions of
any frames that overlap the active frame with that color.
