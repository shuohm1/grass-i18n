v.to.sites - 

The v.to.sites program extracts \site\ data from a GRASS \vector\
\map layer\ and stores output in a new GRASS sites list file.  The
resulting sites map can be used with such programs as \d.sites\.  Only
site (point) features in the user-specified vector map layer are
extracted and placed into the resulting site list.  Lines and areas in
the vector file are ignored.
