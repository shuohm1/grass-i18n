i.class - 

i.class performs the first pass in the GRASS two-pass supervised 
image classification process.  The GRASS program \i.maxlik\
executes the second pass.  Bothe must be run to generate a classified
map in GRASS \raster\ format.

i.class generates spectral signatures for an image by allowing the
user to outline regions of interest.  The resulting signature file
can be used as input for i.maxlik or as a seed signature file for
\i.cluster\.
