g.region - 

g.region allows the user to manage the settings of the current 
\geographic region\.  These regional boundaries can be set by the user
directly and/or set from a regional definition file (stored under the
'windows' directory in the user's current \mapset\).  The user can
create, modify and store as many geographic region definitions as
desired for any given mapset.  However, only one of these definitions 
will be current at any given moment for a specific mapset.
