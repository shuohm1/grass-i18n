v.in.arc - 

v.in.arc converts \vector\ data in ARC/INfO's "Generate" format to
GRASS's vector file format, and brings it into the user's current GRASS
\mapset\.  The files to be imported to GRASS must first have been
exported from ARC/INFO using the ARC/INFO "Ungenerate" command, and may
represent either linear features ("line coverage") or areal features
("polygon coverage").
