p.screen - 

p.screen prints the graphics monitor screen image files created by 
\d.savescreen\ to a color printer.

NOTE:  The input file to p.screen is generated by the program
d.savescreen.  At present, d.savescreen only exists for MASSCOMP
systems.  If you do not have a MASSCOMP, you probably will not be able
to save screens to be printed with p.screen.
