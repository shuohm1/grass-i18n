d.3d displays three-dimensional graphic images based on GRASS \raster\
map layers.  The user identifies the viewing point, the line of sight, a
vertical exaggeration factor, the viewing angle (field of view), the
frequency and color of vector grid lines to appear in the display, the
map to be displayed in 3-d, and the map whose \category values\ are to
be used as elevation values in the 3-dimensional image.
