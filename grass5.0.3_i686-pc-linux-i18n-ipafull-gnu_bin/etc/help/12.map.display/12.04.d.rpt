                  MAP DISPLAY REPORTING FUNCTIONS

The GRASS functions listed below report information about map layers
that are displayed in the current frame on the user's graphics monitor.
Some of these functions use the map layer displayed merely as a frame of
reference, and allow the user to query the contents of other maps in his
search path at a user-cited coordinate location.
