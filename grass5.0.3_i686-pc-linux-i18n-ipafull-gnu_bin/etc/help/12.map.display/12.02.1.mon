                     STARTING A GRAPHICS MONITOR 

To display on-screen GRASS graphics, the user must start and select a
graphics monitor.  The user can run start several graphics monitors
running simultaneously, if his hardware configuration supports this. 
Desired monitor(s) can be started once, and left running even when no
GRASS session is being run.  A monitor program runs in the background. 
Monitors need not be restarted unless they are stopped.
