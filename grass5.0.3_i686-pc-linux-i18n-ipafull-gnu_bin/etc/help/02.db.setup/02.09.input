                   METHODS OF INPUTTING DATA TO GRASS

Data must be digitally stored in a GRASS database in order to be used
by GRASS programs.  Data can be entered into a GRASS database in one
of the following ways:

	(1) Hardcopy data (like paper maps) may be either digitized or
	    scanned into GRASS's vector file format;

	(2) Data already available in another digital format (like ARC-INFO
	    data) may be converted into GRASS's digital data file format,
	    and stored in a GRASS data base;

	(3) GRASS analysis programs can be used to create new GRASS data
	    from data already stored in GRASS digital data file format.

For further information on data entry into a GRASS database, refer to
the "Digitizing and Map Development" section, located at the Help System
Main Menu.
