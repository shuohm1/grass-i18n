             NOTES ABOUT PATCHING:  TO PATCH OR NOT TO PATCH?

Frequently, (due to the size of digitizing tablets) users \digitize\
data in relatively small chunks which must be "patched" together before
data are analyzed.  The GRASS commands listed below can be used to edit
and patch digital data.  Prefixes denote whether commands operate on
data in vector ("v.") or raster ("r.") file format.  For a description
of these formats, read the information contained in "Raster, Vector, and
Sites Data File Formats," located back at this area's menu.

Commands commonly used in the patching process are:

                \-  v.patch \         \-  r.patch \
                \-  v.prune \         \-  r.mapcalc \
                \-  v.spag \

For more information on a specific command, select a command and press
ESC.

"Digitizing and Map Development" topic area, located back at the Help
System Main Menu.
