Comments:
  The NODC can provide specific information about data based 
  on combinations of the following parameters: data type,
  geographic area, time period, cruise, ship or platform,
  country, institution, minimum depth, effective depth,
  taxonomy. The Oceanographic Station Data File & the
  Marine Toxic Substances & Pollutants File can also be
  searched by parameters such as pH, dissolved oxygen, etc..
  See Section 5.0, page 2 of the \"NODC User's Guide"\.

  The NODC is part of the National Environmental Satellite Data &
  Information Service (NESDIS).
