                           TIME OF YEAR 

In most regions, the season of the year at which imagery is flown will
drastically impact landcover.  Consider the application for which
your imagery will be used when selecting a date for imagery.  If you
wish to detect landscape changes occurring over multiple years, attempt
to order satellite data from the same time (month) of each year.
