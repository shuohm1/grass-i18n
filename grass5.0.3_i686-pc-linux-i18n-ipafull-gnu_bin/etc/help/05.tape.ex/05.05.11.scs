Data Description:
  This is an experimental program to provide vector and grid-cell
  soils data. Data is available on a county basis.
  The program was funded by state SCS offices, thus extensive
  data is available for some states, and none for others.


Media:
  9-track 800bpi tape


Aquisition Costs:
  The SCS has not set up a distribution system, so data is provided
  on a case by case basis.
  For areas that have not been digitizied, cost-sharing information
  may be available from the individual state soil conservationists.
