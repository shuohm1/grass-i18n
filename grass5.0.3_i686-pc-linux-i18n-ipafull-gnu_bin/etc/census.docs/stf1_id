C1  Incorporated place that is governmentally active, is not related to an 
     Alaska Native village statistical area (ANVSA), and does not serve as
     a minor civil division (MCD) equivalent
C2  Incorporated place that also serves as a minor civil division (MCD) 
     equivalent because, although the place is coextensive with an MCD,
     the Census Bureau, in agreement with State officials, does not
     recognize that MCD for presenting census data because the MCD cannot
     provide governmental services (Iowa and Ohio only)
C5  Incorporated place that also serves as an MCD equivalent because it is 
     not part of an MCD
C6  Incorporated place that coincides with or approximates an ANVSA
C7  Incorporated place that also serves as a county equivalent; generally 
     referred to as an "independent city"
C8  The portion ("remainder") of a consolidated city that excludes the

A  Active governmental unit, except American Indian reservations and Alaska 
    Native village statistical areas.    An active governmental unit has 
    the legal capacity to have officers, to raise revenue, and to conduct
    governmental activities under State laws, and currently is doing so.
B  Functioning governmental unit providing no substantive governmental 
    services.--These areas may be coextensive with and administered by
    officials of another governmental unit (such as towns in Connecticut
    that are coextensive with cities), or the number of officials and/or
    the functions they perform are so minimal and/or vestigial that the
    Census Bureau does not recognize them as governmental units for census 
    purposes (such as townships in Iowa).
F  False entity.--In order to maintain complete coverage of every State at 
    the county level and of every county at the county subdivision level,
    we create false entities at these levels for any place that is
    independent of a county or independent of a minor civil division (MCD).
    This code also is used for place records that represent the remainder 
    of a consolidated city or the remainder of a county subdivision.
I  Inactive governmental unit.--An inactive governmental unit has the legal
    capacity to be active, but currently has no legal officers, raises no
    revenues, and conducts no activities.
N  Nonfunctioning governmental unit.    A nonfunctioning governmental unit
    has legally established boundaries, but has no legal capacity to
    conduct governmental activity.
R  An American Indian reservation, an American Indian tribe whose name is
    associated with trust lands, or an Alaska Native village statistical
    area.
S  Statistical entity, except Alaska Native village statistical areas and
    tribal jurisdiction statistical areas.    A statistical entity 
    has no governmental status and is defined by or in cooperation with the 
    Census Bureau or other Federal agency.  This category includes census
    regions, census divisions, census county divisions (CCDs), census
    designated places (CDPs), metropolitan areas (MSA/CMSA/PMSAs),
    urbanized areas (UAs), unorganized territories (UTs), tribal designated
    statistical areas (TDSAs), census areas and census subareas in Alaska,
    and comunidades and zonas urbanas in Puerto Rico. 
T  Tribal jurisdiction statistical area.    A tribal jurisdiction
    statistical area (TJSA) is not a legally defined governmental unit, but
    is recognized as a statistical area for the 1990 census.  These areas 
    exist only in the State of Oklahoma and were not recognized separately
    in 1980.

FOOTNOTES

1.  A unique identifier for each file series.  Dress rehearsal files have 
    a "D" in the character following the last character in the file 
    identification code for the equivalent 1990 decennial census file; for 
    example, PL94171D is the identifier for the dress rehearsal file for 
    the P.L. 94-171 data.  File identification code for the P.L. 94-171
    file is PL94171.  File identification codes for summary tape files are
    STFnn where nn = file number; for example, STF1A is the identification
    for Summary Tape File 1A.  File identification codes for subject
    summary tape files are SSTFnn where nn = the number of the subject
    report.  File identification codes for special project files are 
    identified by SPmmm where mmm = a three digit special project number.
    See How to Use This File for further information.

2.  Identifies the geographic level for which the data matrices on the 
    summary tape file have been summarized.  The summary level sequence 
    chart describes the hierarchical arrangement of the specified 
    geographic areas with other geographic areas, if any.  The summary 
    level must be used in combination with the geographic area codes to 
    identify a specific geographic area (for example, summary level 050 and 
    a specific county code must be used together to locate the data for a 
    particular county).  See How to Use This File for further information.

3.  Indicates an iteration (repetition), for the specified summary level, 
    of the data matrices on the summary tape file for the geographic 
    components listed in the Geographic Component field.  See How To Use 
    This File for further information.

4.  Indicates an iteration (repetition), for the specified summary level, 
    of the data matrices on the summary tape file for a population or 
    housing characteristic.  Only matrices containing a "B" in the prefix 
    have characteristic iterations.  See How to Use This File for further 
    information.

5.  The logical record is the complete record [identification and set of 
    tables (matrices)] for a geographic entity defined by the summary 
    level, but exclusive of the characteristic iteration.  A logical record 
    may have one or more parts (or segments).  Each logical record has an 
    assigned sequential integer number within the file.  See How to Use 
    This File for further information.

6.  Within the logical record, each part is identified uniquely in terms of 
    its sequence.  See How to Use This File for further information.

7.  This field identifies how many parts (or segments) comprise the entire 
    logical record.  See How to Use This File for further information.

8.  See appendix A, Area Classifications, for definition of this field if 
    it is applicable to this file.

9.  See the publication, Geographic Identification Code Scheme, for codes 
    in this field and related terminology if it is applicable to this file.   
    See appendix A, Area Classifications, for definition of this field if 
    it is applicable to this file.

10. See the publication, Geographic Identification Code Scheme, for FIPS 55 
    codes in this field and related terminology if it is applicable to this  
    file.  See appendix A, Area Classifications, for definition of this 
    field if it is applicable to this file.

11. Codes in unspecified arrangement for Census Bureau use.

12. Land area measurement in thousandths (.001) of a square kilometer.  The 
    accuracy of the area measurement is limited by the inaccuracy inherent 
    in 1) the mapping of the various boundary features in the TIGER File 
    and 2) rounding affecting the last digit in all operations that compute  
    and/or sum the area measurements.  Land area includes intermittent 
    water and glaciers, which appear on census maps and in the TIGER File 
    as hydrographic features.  An area of .0005 square kilometer is rounded 
    to .001; an area smaller than .0005 is rounded to .000.  The decimal 
    point is implied on the file.  Square miles can be derived by dividing 
    square kilometers by 2.59.  See appendix A, Area Classifications, for 
    definition of this field if it is applicable to this file.

13. Water area measurement in thousandths (.001) of a square kilometer.  
    Water area is excluded from census blocks by definition, so the water 
    area for a block always will be zero.  The accuracy of the area 
    measurement is limited by the inaccuracy inherent in 1) the mapping of 
    the various boundary features in the TIGER File and 2) rounding 
    affecting the last digit in all operations that compute and/or sum the 
    area measurements.  Water area excludes intermittent water and 
    glaciers, which are treated as land even though they appear on census 
    maps and in the TIGER File as hydrographic features.  An area of .0005 
    square kilometer is rounded to .001; an area smaller than .0005 is 
    rounded to .000.  The decimal point is implied on the file.  Square 
    miles can be derived by dividing square  kilometers by 2.59.  See 
    appendix A, Area Classifications, for definition of this field if it is 
    applicable to this file.

14. Name of the lowest-level entity represented by the summary level.  In 
    addition to the name of the entity, the name field contains the 
    political/statistical area description (PSAD) when appropriate, and  
    sometimes contains the State abbreviation.

    For legal entities, the name is the one reported to the Bureau of the 
    Census in the Boundary and Annexation Survey and by other appropriate 
    sources; for statistical entities, the name is determined by the Office    
    of Management and Budget for metropolitan areas and, for other areas, 
    the name is determined by the Bureau of the Census, usually in 
    cooperation with local officials.

    When the summary level represents only part of the area specified in 
    the name, the name usually will have "(pt.)" appended to the name/code 
    terminology to designate that this entry for the entity represents only 
    a part of the total entity.

15. The total number of housing units enumerated in the specified summary 
    level as determined in the 100-percent processing.

16. Latitude in degrees, to six decimal places, of a point within the 
    geographic area represented by the summary level.  The decimal point is 
    implied on the file.  The character immediately preceding the first 
    digit of the latitude of an internal point identifies the direction 
    (hemisphere):  a plus sign (+) indicates the Northern Hemisphere; a 
    minus sign (-) indicates the Southern Hemisphere.  See appendix A, Area 
    Classifications, for definition of this field if it is applicable to 
    this file.

17. Longitude in degrees, to six decimal places, of a point with the 
    geographic area represented by the summary level.  The decimal point is 
    implied on the file.  The character immediately preceding the first 
    digit of the longitude of an internal point identifies the direction 
    (hemisphere):  a plus sign (+) indicates the Eastern Hemisphere; a 
    minus sign (-) indicates the Western Hemisphere.  A point on the 180th 
    meridian is assigned to the Western Hemisphere (-180000000).  See 
    appendix A, Area Classifications, for definition of this field if it is 
    applicable to this file.

18. The total number of persons enumerated in the specified summary level 
    as determined in the 100-percent processing.
